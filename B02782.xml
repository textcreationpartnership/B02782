            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſpeak in Commendation of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in general, were ſo many ways ſuperfluous, that we ſhall rather leave it to the experience of ſober and inquiſitive minds, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the High <hi>Elogiums</hi> given of both the greateſt and wiſeſt <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns,</hi> by a diſadvantagious Repetition of them. And for to ſay any thing concerning the Countrey, which was the Scene of the actions here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, we conceive it needleſs and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in regard we are immured by one Sea, breath one air, ſpeak one Tongue, and now cloſed together by an happy Coalition under one Government.</p>
            <p>The proper work therefore is to offer what can be ſaid of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and the <hi>Author,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:175204:5"/>
and ſo diſmiſs the <hi>Reader</hi> to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Book it ſelf. For his manner of Writing, though he treat of things that are rather many, than great, and troubleſome, than glorious, yet he hath brought ſo much of the main together, as it may be modeſtly ſaid, none of that Nation hath done before him: And for his way of handling it, he hath ſufficiently made it appear, how converſant he was with the Writings of Venerable Antiquity, and how generouſly he hath emulated them by an happy imitation; for the purity of his Language is much above that Dialect he writ in; his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions lively and full, his Narrations clear and pertinent, his Orations Eloquent, and fit for the perſons that ſpeak (for that ſince <hi>Livi</hi>'s time was never accounted Crime in an <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>) and his Reflections ſolid and mature; ſo that it cannot be expected that theſe leaves can be turned over without as much pleaſure as profit, eſpecially frequently meeting with ſo many Glories and Trophies of our Anceſtours; yet becauſe either of theſe may a little abate, in reſpect the beginning ſeems a little abrupt and precipitious (the Author posſibly dying before he could prepare an <hi>Apparatus</hi> or <hi>Introduction</hi> we have taken the pains, out of other Records of that Nation, to draw a brief Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome paſſages neceſſary to be foreknown.</p>
            <p>The direct Royal Line of <hi>Scotland</hi> failing in <hi>Alexander III.</hi> (Son of the <hi>II.</hi> of that name)
<pb facs="tcp:175204:5"/>
who when he a few years before had loſt both his wife, and all his hopeful and numerous iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, nothing remaining of it, ſaving a Girl to his Daughter, brought to <hi>Hungoman</hi> King of <hi>Norway.</hi> The Nobility hereupon meet at <hi>Scone,</hi> and put the Kingdom into the hands of ſix Perſons. <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ſends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Daughter Grand-child in marriage, as next Heir of the Crown. This was agreed unto, Embaſſadours ſent for her, but the death of the Lady fruſtrated all that Negotiation. The death of this <hi>Margaret</hi> (ſo was ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) was the firebrand that ſet <hi>England</hi> on fire, and had almoſt deſtroyed <hi>Scotland;</hi> For two Competitors declared themſelves both powerful and of great Eſtates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſtrongly ſupported with Forrein Confederacies, for <hi>John Baliol</hi> had engaged the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> the <hi>French:</hi> But to be a little clearer we muſt look back; The line thus failing they were forced to run back to the line of <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> Brother to King <hi>William;</hi> this <hi>David</hi> by his wife <hi>Maud</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> had three Daughters, <hi>Margaret,</hi> married to <hi>Allan</hi> of <hi>Galloway,</hi> the ſecond, to <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Noble,</hi> the third, to <hi>Henry Haſtings</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntington,</hi> who made no claim. Now thus it ſtood, <hi>Dornagil,</hi> (the wife of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liol</hi>) claim'd it as grand-child by the Eldeſt Daughter, and <hi>Bruce</hi> as great Grand-child by
<pb facs="tcp:175204:6"/>
the ſecond, ſaying, It was not fit that Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould inherit when there were Sons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Anceſtor; <hi>Baliol</hi> he was neerer, as being in the ſecond degree, and the other but in the third: The Controverſie growing high and boyſterous, and the Power and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of both parties at home being equally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and dangerous, they reſolved to refer it to King <hi>Edward.</hi> who coming to <hi>Berwick</hi> and calling Lawyers to his Aſſiſtance, pretends all Equity, but rais'd up eight other petty Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, the better to weaken the claim of the other two, and ſo handled the buſineſs whilſt the Lawyers were ſlowly conſulting, that (<hi>Bruce</hi> having refuſed to accept the Crown in Homage and Tribute from <hi>England</hi>) he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (upon his acceptance of thoſe conditions) <hi>JOHN BALIOL</hi> to be King, who was Crowned at <hi>Scone.</hi> But ſoon after an appeal being made againſt him to king <hi>Edward</hi> by <hi>Macduff</hi> Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> and he refuſing to riſe from the Seat where he ſate to anſwer, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inforced by the King ſo to do, became ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liened in his affections from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that a new quarrel breaking out between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and both by their Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours Courting the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Amity, it was reſolved to adhere to the <hi>French,</hi> and renounce the Homage to <hi>England,</hi> as obtained by Fraud and Force; <hi>Edward</hi> enraged at this (having obtained a Truce for ſome few Moneths with
<pb facs="tcp:175204:6"/>
the <hi>French</hi>) aſſails <hi>Berwick</hi> by Sea, but with ſome loſs, which enflames him the more, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <hi>Baliol,</hi> who refuſes, proffers it to <hi>Bruce,</hi> takes <hi>Berwick</hi> by Stratagem, enters <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> maſters the Countrey, takes <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and forces <hi>Baliol</hi> to a ſurrender at <hi>Forfar,</hi> and ſends him Priſoner to <hi>London.</hi> whither himſelf returns, having made moſt of the Nobility do Homage, and left the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> his Deputy. <hi>Baliol</hi> ſoon after is ſent into <hi>France,</hi> leaving his Son <hi>Edward</hi> as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage for his fidelity. <hi>Edward</hi> ſets ſail for <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> riſe and make ſome little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions into the Borders; But about this time Sir <hi>William Wallas</hi> aroſe, who, to his Honour, did ſo Heroically defend his Countrey in her weakeſt condition, as made it eaſily appear, if he had had as happy a fortune to advance, as he had a miſerable to relieve, he might have been remembred for as great a man as ever was in any age, for having upon a quarrel ſlain a young <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, and enforced to lurk in the Hills for the ſafety of his life, he became inured to ſuch hardneſs, that awaking his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Courage, he became the head of all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le-contents, and filled both the Kingdoms with his Reputation and Terror, and behaving himſelf according to expectation, glean'd up to a tumultuary Army, and (the Nobility being either ſloathful or cowardly) commanded as <hi>Baliols</hi> Vice-Roy; Thus after ſome little skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes,
<pb facs="tcp:175204:7"/>
he reduced all beyond the <hi>Forth,</hi> took <hi>Dundee, Aberdeen,</hi> and other places, when there arrived rumour of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, which he was not willing to diſpute with, but upon his own Terms. <hi>Edward</hi> that had forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all the Conſiderable places, and kept the chiefeſt of the Nobles as Honorable Priſoners in <hi>England,</hi> had with-drawn his Army, as thinking all ſecure, ſends the Lord <hi>Henry Percey</hi> with ſtrong aſſiſtance to joyn with his Officers there (for he had heard of the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Wallas</hi>) who endeavouring to paſs the <hi>Forth,</hi> the Bridge breaking, received a conſiderable loſs, which gave <hi>Wallas</hi> time to reduce the reſt of the Countrey; <hi>Wallas</hi> then enters <hi>England,</hi> and for ſome time ravages, and returns without oppoſition; and this Fame of his, brought upon him the Envy of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and brought <hi>Edward</hi> with an Army haſtily gathered together at <hi>Stainmore,</hi> from whence after looking upon one another they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without a Blow; from whence <hi>Wallas</hi> came to be rumoured as affecting the Royalty, and brought him ſuch envy among the <hi>Bruces</hi> and <hi>Cumins,</hi> that they were reſolved by any means ro ruin him, as diſdaining that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Kingdom ſhould rely on ſo mean a perſon.

            <p>And here (to digreſs a little) from theſe cruel carnages, might naturally ariſe ſome pretty queſtions, as, Where allegiance and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience begins and determines? who are properly Rebels, or Lawful Enemies? how far the faith of a Nation, or particular men, are concluded in the Oath of their Prince to a Foreiner? and what Limits Conquerours ought to obſerve to Subjects, not naturally born ſo? and how far they, never compacting are oblig'd in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Compact? <hi>But theſe being matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Civilians, and ſuch as cannot be included in the ſhortneſs of a Preface, or Rigor of an Epitome, we ſhall diſmiſs at

this Time without any further diſquiſition.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again, let us obſerve what a ſtrange</hi> Antiperiſtaſis <hi>Oppresſion and Calamity will make in any people, how inconſiderable heads, meeting with an humour of jealouſy, diſcontent and deſpair, ſwell into enormity, and become terrible to, nay oftentimes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, legitimate force, whereas Nations wantoning in their delights and pleaſures (like ſtrong bodies without Exerciſe) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, and weaken themſelves, whilſt their

            <p>But it is high time now to return unto ROBERT BRUCE, who having cauſed himſelf (after he had ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Popes abſolution for the defiling the Monaſtery with the Murder of the <hi>Cumins</hi>)<note place="margin">1306.</note> to be Crowned K. at <hi>Scone,</hi> notwithſtanding his Endeavours at firſt to ſtrengthen himſelf, by the enmity of the <hi>Cumins,</hi> and timorouſneſs of his own Followers, was routed by <hi>Edwards</hi> Lievtenants, and forced to the Hills, and for a long time lurkt in great miſery, to the great ruine and ſlaughter of his Family and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but making together ſome little force, took <hi>Carrick</hi> and <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> by ſurpriſal, and by this means augmented his Train; and withſtood the daring <hi>Cumin</hi> Earl of <hi>Bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han;</hi> who withſtood him with a Conſiderable ſtrength of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> forces, and though a Treaty were deſired, would not comply, growing numerous by the acceſſion of other conſiderable perſons. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>I.</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an intended expedition thither left it to <hi>Edward II.</hi> his Son, who hearing ſome troubles in <hi>France,</hi> ſailed thither, and left behind him an Army, which notwithſtanding <hi>Robert,</hi> though ſick and forced to be held on
<pb facs="tcp:175204:9"/>
horſeback, defeated; this engaged <hi>Edward</hi> to another Immemorable Expedition, and gave <hi>Robert</hi> time to take in the Remaining ſtrengths; but the next year,<note place="margin">1310.</note> and within two years after, recovered the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Edinburgh</hi> it ſelf, and a little after, by means of his Brother <hi>Edward, Sterlin</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conditions. <hi>Edward</hi> thereupon enters with a great Army, and many forein auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries; But had a great defeat at <hi>Bannocks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> which occaſioned the loſs of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and <hi>Bruces</hi> confirmation in Parliament, the declaring of <hi>Edward</hi> (his Brother) to be heir, in caſe of <hi>Robert</hi>'s want of iſſue Male, as alſo making of him King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at the requeſt of ſome of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and though they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him with ſome forces for that attempt, yet in the Expedition he and all his followers were cut to pieces.

A Prince,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1330.</note> 
               <hi>that mounting the Throne over the Carcaſſes of his neereſt kindred, encountring with the greateſt, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and calamities of a country oppreſt by powerful and martial Enemies, bravely ſtruggled with the diſadvantages, and left behind him the Character of a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a prudent Prince, and ſuch an one
<pb facs="tcp:175204:12"/>
as whoſe Reputation relies upon his ſingle virtue, unleſs you will ſay he had the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the heads and hands of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Captains yet even in the chuſing of One, and the obeying the Other, it muſt be confeſt he was a man excellently ſquared out for government, and a man the moſt fit to arreſt our conqueſts in that Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet, by the way, we ſhall take up one Remark, How much the fortune and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any people, depends upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Supreme Governour; and we cannot have better inſtance, than by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the preceeding Hiſtory.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>I. (worthily called</hi> Coeur de Lion) <hi>brought them in their greateſt power upon their knees; His Son (an effeminate and weak Prince, enchanted with Flatteries, and loſt in Softneſs) could not preſerve an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Dominion, but loſt it with ignominy; His ſon, for a time (which we muſt call his pupillage of War, he did ſuch wonders afterwards) was unſucceſsful, and all this through the Oppoſition, Courage and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of one unfortunate perſon; And indeed, upon ſurvey of all Hiſtories, we ſhall find, that the ability and excellency of the Prince hath been the moſt powerful aſcendent of the Genius of a Nation, and that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mind of the World, when ever it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines any to glorious actions, raiſes up
<pb facs="tcp:175204:12"/>
ſuch Leaders, as by their wiſdom, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, may lead them to the performance of its own ſecret determinations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And again, How infectious the example of a bad or weak Prince, which, like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy contagion, perverts and infects the manners of a people, and ſo much the more eaſily ſeduces them, by how much the mind of man is inclinable to underſtand better things, and purſue the worſe, and moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are more eaſily emaſculated into Vice, than tutured into Virtue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince being gone to his long home, DAVID BRUCE His Son, ſucceeding,<note place="margin">1331</note> his Coronation was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred till permiſſion could be had from <hi>Rome</hi> to make the buſineſs more ſolemn. The firſt thing memorable in his reign was the ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſort of Thieves, by <hi>Randolph,</hi> who (if you will believe the <hi>Scotiſh Story</hi>) was ſoon after poiſened by a Monk, yet bore it ſo, as he eluded another invaſion, though he died ſoon after in the year <hi>1331.</hi> the Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving to the Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> in which he was ſcarce warm, when news was brought that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baliol</hi> was ſeen in the <hi>Fryth</hi> with a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Fleet; And it was upon this occaſion, <hi>Lawrence Twine,</hi> a Fugitive <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> that had planted himſelf in <hi>Scotland,</hi> being for his lewd life excommunicated, ſlew the

Biſhop of <hi>Final,</hi> and uſed ſuch inducements to <hi>Edward</hi> (Son of <hi>John Baliol,</hi> formerly King) by the minority of the King, the raging diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of the People and Exiles, the want of the Regents, <hi>Randolf</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> that he, knowing <hi>Edward</hi> prepared great Forces againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> perſuaded him to imbarque in the Enterprize, and he made ſo good a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he landed at <hi>Kingkorn,</hi> and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Alexander Seatoun,</hi> who made ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and marching to <hi>Perth,</hi> did, by a ſecret paſſage over the River, rout the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſlay the moſt conſiderable Commander, and take the Town, taking Priſoners alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the beſt quality, ſo that growing nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by the acceſſion of ſuch as had a mind to ſhare in his good and unexpected Fortune, he in the year <hi>1332.</hi>

The laſt five years of his reign were ſpent in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing domeſtick fewds, and are notable for a great inundation and plague; but things quieting in the year <hi>1363.</hi> he retired into a Monaſtery, and declared (in caſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe) <hi>Edward,</hi> or his Son, for their King. This, whether it was cauſed by ſome former Oath, or from wearineſs of War, or deſign of quiet to Both Nations, which being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally diſliked by the Eſtates it was like to breed a diſſention, which his wiſdome cloſed up. All was now quiet but the Highlanders, whom he appeaſed by their mutual diſcords; when Fate in the <hi>47.</hi> year of his Age, and <hi>39</hi> of his Reign, came to Eternal Reſt, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> in the year <hi>1370.</hi>

               <hi>By this King and his competitour</hi> Baliol <hi>(who went out in the ſnuff) we may in part meaſure the intereſts &amp; advantages of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the one by the aſiſtance of a Potent Neighbour did unexpected things, yet failed in Conduct and Managment; the other, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting neither ſpirit nor vigilancy, became a Captive and ineffectual Prince; which may give us occaſion to obſerve, That tho Travel do beſt inrich the mind with variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, yet it is not ſo ſucceſsful in Princes; for their Minds not being exempted from humane weakneſs, may draw in tinctures &amp; prejudices not conſiſting with the humors of them they are to govern, and by knowing abroad grow ſtrangers at home, neglecting to ſtudy the humor of the People they are ſet over; the diſquiſition of which is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt Miſtery and Chain of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The People being an unruly Beaſt, eaſily led, impoſſible to be forc'd, and the Magick that ſo powerfully forces them, no other than a peircing, diſcerning, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or eluding their Humour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was</hi> Davids <hi>Fundamental fault, which, like Error in the firſt concoction, multiplied it ſelf through the reſt of his Reign. he was bred a Stranger, knew not the diſpoſition of his people, met with troubleſome Times, and a Formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and therefore he may very well be
<pb facs="tcp:175204:16"/>
charged with three overſights; Firſt, after three, not unfortunate, incurſions into</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>then imployed by</hi> France, <hi>not to reſt there with his proportion of glory and prey: But ſecondly, By the allurement of the</hi> French <hi>King, and that upon a ſcore of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; whereas Friendſhips of Princes and Private Men are different, the one being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: the other diffuſive and concerning Millions; beſides, that Princes are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the intereſt of their States, not their private inclinations. And for the third, To make an invaſion, when he left ſo high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents in a turbulent people behind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of his own, that by force, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or intereſt were devoted to a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enemy, and aſſured of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was very imprudential, both in going to find out an Enemy, whoſe force he knew not, and leaving behind him Subjects, whoſe malice and force he underſtood not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But no more to diſturb his aſhes; Had he had another Country, another Enemy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Education, and other Circumſtances of Time, he might have been as glorious as any of his Predeceſſors, it is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable (though the Change of Time does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heighten and aggravate the Vices of Princes) there is nothing either Cruel or Vitious recorded of him, So that even in the ſevereſt ſenſe we may diſmiſs him with
<pb facs="tcp:175204:16"/>
this Character, That he was rather unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than ſloathful in his Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mans eyes being for ever cloſed, the Nobility appointed a meeting for the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of ROBERT STUART For their King, as he was formerly deſigned, who appeaſed the diſſention of the Earl <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> by marrying his Daughter to the Earl's Son. His firſt two years were ſpent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king incurſions upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Kings wife dying in the next year, he marries <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Moor</hi> his own Concubine, the better to legitimate the children he had by her, and them he honoured with Titles, and declared his Succeſſors; two years after an attempt is made on <hi>Berwick,</hi> but in vain, and <hi>Talbots</hi> Expedition fruſtrated, but a Truce for three years was concluded; which being expired, little quarrels awoke again, and occaſioned the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to be ſent thither with a great Army and Navy, though not with the ſame fortune at Sea as at Land, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the return of the Duke, who was purſued by ſome ſmall depredations of <hi>William Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> though his Son of the ſame name, and ſome others, during the Treaty made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road as far as <hi>Newcaſtle.

<pb facs="tcp:175204:17"/>
with a great Army, fac'd the <hi>Scots</hi> with an unbloody bravery. The <hi>Scots</hi> deſigning to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Roxburgh,</hi> but quarrelling with the <hi>French,</hi> it came to nothing; which occaſioned ſo much diſſention, that it arrived at this paſs, That the <hi>French</hi> ſhould pay for their plunder and be diſmiſt, their General remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as hoſtage for their ſatisfaction; whilſt <hi>William Dowglaſs</hi> (who had married the Kings Daughter) makes an Expedition into <hi>Ireland,</hi> plunders <hi>Kerlingford,</hi> and knowing his Father to be imployed againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> haſten to his aſſiſtance. The attempt was in affront of <hi>Richard</hi> then ſtrugling with Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick difficulties; But they of <hi>Scotland</hi> being unable to live without War and Rapine, they were reſolved to make a buſineſs of it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King, and his eldeſt Son were infirm, came to chooſe (privately) the ſecond for their Leader; but this being diſcovered by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> they altered their Reſolution, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divide themſelves, one by the way of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> the other of <hi>Carliſle</hi> the former Party led by <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> gave a defeat to the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> with the loſs of his Life the other not having the like Succeſs) who impatiently fighting before the coming up of the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Forces, loſt his own and indangered the others.</p>
            <p>This happened in the year <hi>1388.</hi> at <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburn</hi> in <hi>Northumberland.</hi> The King being ſpent with age, makes <hi>Robert</hi> his ſecond Son

his Vice-Roy, (his eldeſt being unactive) who to affront <hi>Percey,</hi> that ſeemed to leſſen the loſs, led in an Army, but after facing return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome little depredation. Soon after a Peace was mediated between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in which <hi>Robert,</hi> without conſent of a Parliament, would not be compriſed; But his doubts were all reſolved by death in the year <hi>1390.</hi> when he had lived <hi>74.</hi> years, and reigned <hi>19.</hi> being followed to the grave with ſuch acts of Barbariſm, as have heen frequent in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is a Prince we find little ſaid of, as to his perſon, and poſſibly beſt to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Negative; We find many things done by his Captains, not by him; which notwithſtanding we may rather attribute to the ſtirring and violent humour of that age, than either his age, want of Genius, or love of quiet; yet herein appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of his Character, that meeting with turbulent times, and a martial people, he met not with any Inſurrections, and was a gainer; and though he did it by other hands, we muſt ſuppoſe that their Motions were directed by his Brain, that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Motion and Spirits unto them, ſince the Minds of Kings, like the firſt Mover, turn all about, yet are not perceived to move, and it was no humane wit ſaid their hearts were unſcrutable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:175204:18"/>The ſame year his Eldeſt Son <hi>John</hi> was caled to ſucceed, who thinking that name ominous to Kings &amp; there wanted not examples) as of him of <hi>England,</hi> and him of <hi>France,</hi> and fancying ſomewhat of the felicity of thoſe two former <hi>Roberts,</hi> was crowned King by the name of ROBERT the III.</p>
            <p>This man being unactive, the weight of the Government reſted upon his Brother <hi>Robert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt ſeven years of his Reign paſt in a calm with <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of two Truces, but not without ſome fierce fewds among his Subjects, one whereof was very memorable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Thomas Dunbar</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> and and <hi>James Lindſay</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> and was moſt high, inſomuch that ſeeing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reducing them, he reſolved to make this propoſition to them. That <hi>300.</hi> of each ſide, ſhould try it by dint of Sword before the King, the Conquered to be pardoned, and the Conquerour advanced; This being agreed on, a place was appointed on the Northſide of St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> but when they came to joyn battel, there was one of one ſide miſſing, whom when his party could not ſupply, and none would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh the other, a Tradeſman ſtept out, and for half a <hi>French Crown,</hi> and promiſe of maintenance for his life, filled up the company.</p>
            <p>The fight was furious, but none behaved himſelf more furiouſly than the Mercenary Champion, who they ſay was the greateſt cauſe of
<pb facs="tcp:175204:18"/>
the Victory, for of his ſide there remained ten grievouſly wounded, the other party had but one left who not being wounded, yet being unable to ſuſtain the ſhock of the other, threw himſelf into the <hi>Tey</hi> and eſcaped. By this means the fierceſt of two <hi>Clanns</hi> being cut off, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being headleſs, were quiet. Two years after, the King in Parliament made his two Sons Dukes,<note place="margin">1398</note> a title then firſt brought into <hi>Scotland.</hi> Next year <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond of <hi>England</hi> being forced to reſign, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth ſucceeded, in the beginning of whoſe reign, though the Truce was not ended, the ſeeds of War began to bloom out, and upon this occaſion, <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Daughter to <hi>David</hi> the Kings eldeſt Son: <hi>Archibald</hi> Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> not brooking this, gets a vote of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for revocation of this marriage, and by the power of <hi>Robert,</hi> the Kings Brother, made a marriage between <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter, and <hi>David,</hi> and, giving a greater ſum, got it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Parliament. The Earl of <hi>March,</hi> nettled at this, demands redreſs, but being not heard, leaves the Court, and with his Family and Friends goes into <hi>England,</hi> to the Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> an utter Enemy of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> waſt<hi>'s March,</hi> and eſpecially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predating the lands of the <hi>Dowglaſſes.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> declare the Earl of <hi>March</hi> an Enemy, and ſend to demand him up of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:175204:19"/>
who deny to ſurrender him. This made <hi>Hot-ſpur Percy</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> make ſeveral incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions into <hi>Scotland,</hi> till at laſt they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed at <hi>Linton</hi>-Bridge by the <hi>Dowglaſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1400.</note>This was about the year four hundred, at which time War was denounced, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> entred with a great Army, took <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> and <hi>Lieth,</hi> and laid ſiege to <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> Caſtle, <hi>David</hi> the Kings Son being within it, which the new Governour, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly delaying to relieve, the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the terrour they brought, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired again. After which <hi>March</hi> did not ceaſe his little incurſions; which to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of, <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> divided his Forces into two Squadrons, the firſt to <hi>Halyburton,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Barmborough,</hi> with ſome prey; the ſecond and greater to <hi>Patrick Hepburn,</hi> who unwarily roving with his prey, was ſet on by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and with all the youth of <hi>Lothian,</hi> put to the Sword. To revenge this, <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> gets together <hi>10000.</hi> men, and paſſing beyond <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> met with young <hi>Percy,</hi> &amp;c. who at <hi>Homildon,</hi> a little village in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the year <hi>1401.</hi> gave gave him and his Party ſuch a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, as <hi>Scotland</hi> had not receiv'd the like for a long time. This put <hi>Percy</hi> in hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all beyond the <hi>Fryth,</hi> but the troubles at home withdrew him from that deſign. By this <hi>Annibal</hi> the Queen dying, <hi>David</hi> her Son,
<pb facs="tcp:175204:19"/>
who by her means had been reſtrained, broke out into his natural diſorders, and committed all kind of Rapine and Luxury. Complaint being brought to his Father, he commits him to his Brother the Governour (whoſe ſecret deſign being to root out the off-ſpring) the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was ſo ordered, as that the young man was ſhut up in <hi>Falkland</hi> Caſtle to be ſtarved, which yet was for a while delayed, one woman thruſting in ſome thin Oaten Cakes at a chink, and another giving him milk out of her paps through a Trunck. But both theſe being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the youth being forced to tear his own members, died of a multiplied death; which murder being whiſpered to the King, and the King inquiring after it, was ſo abuſed by the falſe repreſentations of his Brother, that grief and imprecations was all the relief he had left him, as being now retired ſickly to <hi>Bote-Caſtle,</hi> and unable to puniſh him. The King being ſolicitous of <hi>James</hi> his younger Son, is reſolved by the example of the good uſage of <hi>David,</hi> to ſend him to <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of <hi>France,</hi> and having taken Shipping at the <hi>Baſſe,</hi> as he paſt by the Promontory of <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> whether forc'd by tempeſt, or that he was Sea-ſick, he was forc'd to land, taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and detained, notwithſtanding the allegation of a Truce of eight years, and his Fathers Letters. And though it came to
<pb facs="tcp:175204:20"/>
the Privy Council to be debated, yet his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was carried in the Affirmative. This advantage he had by his Captivity, that he was well and carefully educated; but the News ſo ſtruck his Father, that he had almoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently died, but being carried into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with voluntary abſtinence and ſorrow he ſhortned his life, three days longer, <hi>viz.</hi> to the firſt of April. <hi>1406.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was a man of a goodly and a comely perſonage, one rather fit for the tranquillity of a private life, than the agitations of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and indeed ſuch an one whoſe Reigns do little elſe but fill up Chronologies with the number of their years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this the Parliament confirm <hi>Robert</hi> for Governour, a man of parts able enough for that employment, but a man of ſuch a violent and inveterate ambition, as would ſacrifice any thing to make it fuel to it ſelf. Soon after <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> were reconciled.</p>
            <p>In the year <hi>1411. Donald</hi> the Iſlander, Lord of the <hi>Budae,</hi> enters <hi>Roſs,</hi> as his pretended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, with ten thouſand men, and eaſily reduced it, and fluſhed by this, goes to <hi>Murray,</hi> which being ſtrengthleſs, he eaſily maſtered, and paſs'd ſpoiling into <hi>Bogy,</hi> and approached
<pb facs="tcp:175204:20"/>
               <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> To ſtop this torrent, <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> followed by moſt of the Nobility, met him at <hi>Harley,</hi> a Village beyond <hi>Tey,</hi> where they joyned in ſo bloody a Battle, and loſt ſo many noble and conſiderable Perſons, that though Night parted them, neither could pretend to the Victory. To this year doth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> owe its riſe. The next ten years nothing was done between the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh; Henry</hi> the <hi>V.</hi> ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father, and being wholly intent for <hi>France,</hi> there was little to do between the two Nations, unleſs ſome ſmall incurſions. In the year <hi>1419.</hi> Auxiliaries were ſent into <hi>France,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1419</note> and employed in <hi>Turain,</hi> but they making mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Eaſter-Holidays, the Duke of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> being informed thereof, marches with a party to them; but notwithſtanding finding a ſtout repulſe, was himſelf, with many of his Souldiers ſlain. Whilſt this happens in <hi>France,</hi> in the year <hi>1420. Robert</hi> the Governour dies, and <hi>Mordack</hi> his Son, a Sot, was put in his place, which he was ſo fit for, that he could not govern his three Sons, which was the cauſe of the Fathers and their ruines. This Domeſtick Change called home the Forces em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in <hi>France,</hi> but things being ſetled, others went in their places. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> hearing of the death of <hi>Clarence,</hi> made <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>BEDFORD</hi> his Vice-Roy,
<pb facs="tcp:175204:21"/>
himſelf intending to follow, and carry <hi>JAMES</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> along with him, the better either to win or ſuſpend the hearts of the <hi>Scots;</hi> but it was in vain, for they ſaid they would not obey a man, that had not his own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Much action paſt afterwards between them and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but we haſten to cloſe with the Author.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MORDACK,</hi> as it hath been ſaid, being Governour, having neglected all Diſcipline at home, ſuffered his Sons to come to that petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy, that they were not only offenſive to all the people, but withal diſobedient to their Father, who having a brave <hi>Faulcon,</hi> which his Son <hi>WALTER</hi> had often begged, but in vain, he ſnatch'd it out of his Fathers hand, and wrung off her neck, which his Father being angry at, <hi>Well</hi> ſays he, <hi>Since I cannot govern thee, I will bring one ſhall govern us both:</hi> And from that day he ceaſed not to further the Redemption of the <hi>KING,</hi> which was after ordered at an Aſſembly at <hi>Perth,</hi> and an honourable Embaſſy ſent into <hi>England, With which this Author begins his Hiſtory, and we conclude this petty Labour.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>WILLIAM DRUMMOND was the Son of</hi> Sir <hi>JOHN DRUMMOND, and was born in the year 1585. and was brought up in</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>where having paſt through his courſe of Philoſophy, he took the Degree of Maſter of Arts, and in the year 1606. went into FRANCE, to ſtudy the Laws, as a way to raiſe him to preferment at Court. But his wit being of a greater delicacy, could not engage on the toyls and difficulties of that ſtudy, as being wholly inclined to eaſe and retirement, and a proſecution of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier and ſofter entertainment of the Muſes. In this humour (for he was eſpecially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb facs="tcp:175204:22"/>
to POETRY, having for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſufficiently maſtered the GREEK. LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINE, FRENCH, SPANISH, and ITALIAN Tongues, as may appear by all his things of that nature) lived retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with his Brother-in-Law, till he was five and forty years of age, at which time he unexpectedly married MARGARETE LOGANE, a younger Daughter of the Houſe of RESTELRIG.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He was not more retired in his Perſon then careleſs of his Fame, (all his Poems being Printed in looſe ſheets, and only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to his Friends.) Yet though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated from all the World, yet he was ſtill found out; for all the Learned, and men of Quality, gave him his due reſpect. As for his own Countrey-men, the Earl of STER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN, LEOCHEM, and Doctor JOHN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON. Beſides, though he were little in ENGLAND, yet DANIEL DRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, and JOHNSON viſit him by their Letters, and teſtifyed their eſteem of him. All that we have of him is this Book, and his Poems, of which when they are to be publiſhed, you will have better information. In this manner he continued a harmleſs, and a virtuous life, till in the year 1649. he was ſummoned to pay his great debt to Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:175204:22"/>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF THE Reign of <hi>James</hi> the firſt, KING of SCOTLAND.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi> being wearied with the form of their preſent Government; for tho they had a <hi>King,</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed not the happineſs of his ſway, by his reſtraint afar off, under the power of a Stranger; ſome of them were poſſeſſed with hopes by the change of the <hi>Head,</hi> to find a change in the <hi>Body</hi> of the State. and a flow of their ebbing Fortunes; the <hi>Church-men</hi> and the <hi>Gentry</hi> having ever continued loyal and well-affected to the Lawful Heir of the Crown; the <hi>Commons,</hi> men delighting in Novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ordinarily preferring uncertainties, things unſeen and to come, to what for the time they did hold and enjoy; the Governor of the Kingdom alſo himſelf, irritated by the miſdemeanour of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and forecaſting the danger he might be plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175204:25"/>
into, if the States ſhould purchaſe the recovery of their King, he not complying to their Deſign: all unanimouſly and together determine without longer prolongings to work the delivery of their Native Prince <hi>JAMES</hi> forth of <hi>England</hi> where he had been detained eighteen years as a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>They who were choſen and got Commiſſion to negotiate his Liberty were <hi>Archembald</hi> Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> Son to <hi>Archembald</hi> Duke of <hi>Turrain, William Hay</hi> Conſtable of the Realm, <hi>Alexander Irwin</hi> of <hi>Drumm</hi> Knight, <hi>Henry Lightoun</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen, Alexander Cornwall</hi> Arch-Dean of <hi>Lothian,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe coming to <hi>London</hi> were graciouſly received by the State, and ſeverally entertained by King <hi>James,</hi> and ſo many friends as either his Alliance or Virtues had acquired. After ſome few days ſtay de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to have audience in Counſel they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where Biſhop <hi>Lightoun</hi> is ſaid to have ſpoken to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reſpect and reverence which the Nation of the</hi> Scots <hi>carryeth toward all Kings is all where known, but moſt that love and loyalty which they have to the ſacred Perſons of their own native Princes: for as Monarchy is the moſt ancient form of Government, ſo have they ever eſteemed it the beſt, it being more eaſie to find one inſtructed and trained up in heroical virtues, than to find many. And how well ſoever Governours and Vice-Gerents rule the Commmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, yet is that Government but as the light of the Moon or ſtars in abſence of the Sun, and but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of ſhadows for real Bodies. This hath moved the three eſtates of that Kingdom to direct us here unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our King theſe many years hath been kept from us, upon juſt or unjuſt Grounds we will not argue, that providence which hath appointed every thing to its
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175204:25"/>
own end, hath done this for the beſt, both to you and us, and we are now to treat with you for his Delivery. Beſeeching you to remember that his Father of Sacred memory recommended him out of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duty which one Prince oweth to another, to your Kings Protection, in hope of Sanctuary, and in requeſt of aid and comfort againſt ſecret, and therefore the more dangerous, Enemies, And to confeſs the Truth, hitherto he hath heen more aſſured amongſt you, than if he had remained in his own Countrey, your favours being many ways extended towards him: having in all liberal Sciences and vertues brought him up. That his abode with you ſeemeth rather to have been a remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Academy, then in any Captivity, and thus he had been loſt if he had not been loſt. Beſides, tho we have the happineſs to claim his Birth and Stem, ye have the claim of his Succeſſion and Education, He being now matched with the Royal Blood of</hi> England <hi>in Marriage. Thus his Liberty which we entreat for, is a benefit to your ſelves, and thoſe Princes which ſhall claim the deſcent of his off-ſpring. For if it ſhould fall forth (as what may not, by the variable changes of Kingdomes, come to paſs?) that this Prince by Uſurpers and Rebels were diſgarniſhed of his own Crown, they are your Swords which ſhould brandiſh, to ſet him on his Royal throne. We expect that as ye have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways rendred him yours, ye will not refuſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Him yet more by his Liberty, which he muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge wholly and freely to receive from you: and by benefits and love to overcome a King, is more than by force of Arms. And ſince he was not your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by chance of War (having never raiſed Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you) but by way of Protection detained here, and entertained, ſo ye will, reſpecting your ancient ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Generoſity, ſend him freely back to his own; yet if it be ſo that ye will have acknowledgment, for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175204:26"/>
what ye have beſtowed on his education, the diſtreſs of the preſent eſtate of his Subjects and Crown conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, We will not ſtand upon trifles of Money for the Redemption of a Prince above all price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords of the Council were diverſe ways in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to this Embaſſie, ſome thought it not fit to diſmiſs him. For his remaining in <hi>England</hi> ſeemed the more to aſſure the kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> unto them; having the King and his children in their cuſtody what dared they not enterpriſe, or not bring to paſs? Or if <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould plot any thing by way of Rebellion, the King having his party within the Realm, by the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would keep under the other Factions; and thus the Eſtate by both being made weak, it would be a fair breach for a Conqueſt, and the annexing that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he knew too much of the Eſtate and affairs of <hi>England</hi> to be ſent away to a Nation ever their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, That being at liberty and amongſt his own, he might reſent the injury of his long reſtraint,</p>
               <p>Others of the Council thought it beſt to diſmiſs him, They had learned by experience that the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> hindered no ways the <hi>Scots</hi> from aſſiſting the <hi>French,</hi> yea rather that it did exaſperate their choler, and make them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge addict themſelves wholly to the <hi>French:</hi> the Governour no ways keeping to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>French,</hi> upon whom to be revenged they could find no ſurer way than to ſet at liberty the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe return of neceſſity muſt needs change the face of the State, and trouble him. As for the conqueſt of the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was not at that time of ſuch moment for <hi>England,</hi> they having the moſt part of <hi>France</hi> in their Subjection, which was as much, if not more, as they could hold, then it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175204:26"/>
would prove a more harmleſs and ſure purchaſe to make <hi>Scotland</hi> theirs, by the Succeſſion of <hi>Lady Jane</hi> of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> than by war, the event whereof is ever doubtful and beyond any aſſurance of Man. The Liberty of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> might prevent the encreaſing ſtrength of the Kings Enemies in <hi>France,</hi> and ſecure the Peace and tranquillity of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth at home: King <hi>James</hi> being all <hi>Engliſh</hi> by education, if he proved not of their Party, yet he muſt prove neutral to both the Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, then <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> being of under-age was governed by his three Uncles of his Fathers ſide, <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was made Protector of his Perſon and Realm, <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> who was eſtabliſhed Regent of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Exceſter.</hi> But <hi>Henry Beaufoord</hi> Cardinal, Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> and Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> a man eminent in Blood and Riches, Uncle to the Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> in effect governed all. Theſe gave way, rather then approved that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scots</hi> ſhould be ſet at liberty and ſent home. And though they would have diſmiſſed him freely, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Dowry of his <hi>Queen,</hi> which was not delivered, having uſe of preſent moneys for the maintenance of the Wars in <hi>France,</hi> and the more to cover the injuſtice of his Captivity, they thought it expedient to ſet a Ranſom upon him.</p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners having met, it was declared, that for a ſufficient ſum of moneys their King might return and enjoy his own Liberty; the one half to be paid in hand, able Hoſtages remaining in <hi>England</hi> till the other half was fully diſcharged. The Ranſom agreed upon was <hi>four hundred thouſand Marks,</hi> but by the power of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> the third was diſcharged, for which he was long after accuſed before the King by the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:175204:27"/>The Governour and Eſtate of <hi>Scotland</hi> having known the ſum laid upon them for the Liberty of the <hi>King,</hi> though the haſty acquiring of it was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous unto them, preferring Glory and things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to matters of money, immediatly diſpatched ſo ſo much as could be gathered, together with a great many young Noblemen of the Kingdom to remain Hoſtages for the reſt; who (after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) were <hi>David</hi> ſon to the Earl of <hi>Athol, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gordon, John</hi> de <hi>Lyndeſay, Patrick</hi> Son and Heir to Sir <hi>John Lyon, David</hi> de <hi>Ogleby,</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> de <hi>Ruthen, Miles Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, David Mowbray</hi> and <hi>William Oliphant.</hi> Theſe were honorably received entertained and kept. The Kings Father in Law, the Earl of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal his Brother, accompanied their Niece to the Borders, and there taking their leave returned back. The <hi>King</hi> with the reſt of their Train, received with many Troops of Nobles and Gentlemen, who ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all parts of the Kingdom to give him a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful welcome into his Native ſoyl, and themſelves the contentment of beholding one they had ſo long deſired and expected, with loud acclamations and applauſes of the Commons as he held his Progreſs, on the Paſſion Week in Lent came to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During his abode there, he aſſembled many of the Eſtates, liſtened to their Petitions, prepared for the approaching Parliament, which had been ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before his coming, The Solemnities of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> finiſhed, the <hi>King</hi> came with his <hi>Queen</hi> to <hi>Perth,</hi> and from thence in the beginning of the moneth of <hi>May</hi> to <hi>Scone,</hi> where the year 1424. by <hi>Mordock</hi> the Governour, Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and Earl of <hi>Fife</hi> (to whom that charge by cuſtom of the Kingdom did appertain) and <hi>Henry</hi> Biſhop of S. <hi>Andrews</hi> the 27 year of his Age, there was a joynt Coronation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175204:27"/>
and his Queen, being according to the Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the old <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Hiſtory, the hundreth and one King of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At which time <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> ſon to <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth,<note place="margin">An. Dom. <hi>1424.</hi>
                  </note> was Emperour of the <hi>Weſt.

               </p>
               <p>The ends in calling the Parliament were the Coronation of the King, to make the People ſee a Princes authority was come where they had but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Governours; the eſtabliſhing a Peace amongſt the Subjects, and taking away all Factions, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting a Subſidie for the relief of the Hoſtages in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> To this laſt, the Nobles held ſtrong hand, by reaſon many of their Sons were engaged. Here a a general tax was condeſcended upon through the whole Realm, as twelve pennies of the pound to be paid of all Lands, as well Spiritual as Temporal, and four pennies of every Cow, Ox, Horſe, for the ſpace of two years together. When the Commons had taken it grievouſly that the Subſidie, granted by the ſtates of the Kingdom in Parliament, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted moſtly of them; after the firſt Collection, the King pitying their poverty, remitted what was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payed, and until the Marriage of his Daughter, thereafter never exacted any Subſidie of his Subjects. For he would gently ſtrain milk, and not wring blood from the breaſt of his Countrey, rendring the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure thereof, chaſte, ſincere and pure for expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neceſſary and profitable, not for profuſions, which neither afford contentment nor reputation; for money is both the nerves which give motion and veins, which entertain life in a State. Amongſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175204:28"/>
others whom the King honoured, <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son to Duke <hi>Mordock,</hi> was dubbed Knight.</p>
               <p>The Parliament diſſolving, the King came from <hi>Perth</hi> to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where having aſſembled all the preſent Officers, and ſuch who had born Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the State during the time of Duke <hi>Robert,</hi> and Duke <hi>Mordock,</hi> eſpecially thoſe whoſe charge concerned the Rents of the Crown, he underſtood by their accounts, that the moſt part of all the Rents, Revenues and Lands pertaining to the Crown, were waſted, alienated and put away, or then by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors beſtowed on their freinds and followers, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of Towns and Burroughs only excepted. This a little incenſed his indignation, yet did he ſmother and put a fair countenance on his paſſion, ſeeming to ſlight what he moſt car'd for: occaſion thereafter no ſooner ſerved when he began to countenance and give way to Promoters and Informers (neceſſary though dangerous Inſtruments of State, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Princes have been content to maintain, and ſuch who were not bad never denied to hear, but uſing them no longer then they were neceſſary for their ends) to rip up ſecret and hidden crimes, wrongs ſuffered, or committed during the time of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion in <hi>England.</hi> He received the complaints of the Church-men, Countrey Gentlemen, Merchants againſt all thoſe who had either wronged them or the State, and would have the cauſes of all Accuſers to be heard and examined: Here many to obtain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Prince, accuſed others.</p>
               <p>Upon pregnant accuſations <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> one of the Sons of Duke <hi>Mordock</hi> was Arreſted and ſent to the <hi>Baſs,</hi> to be cloſe kept; ſo was <hi>Malcolm Fleming</hi> of <hi>Cammernauld</hi> and <hi>Thomas Boyd</hi> of <hi>Kilmarnock</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Ward in <hi>Dalkieth.</hi> Not long after (the Nobility interceding) <hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> goods
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:175204:28"/>
being reſtored which they had taken wrongfully, and Fines laid upon them for their Offence, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſatisfie all whom they had wrong'd, were pardoned all faults, and then ſet at Liberty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> by liſtening to Promoters. came to the knowledge of many great inſolencies committed by ſundry of his Nobles, which as it bred a hatred in him, ſo fear in them, and both appeared to ſtudy a Novation; They for their own ſafety, He to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Juſtice and his Authority. The Duke had highly reſented the committing of his Son, as had his Father in Law the Earl of <hi>Lennox.</hi> The Male-contents being many, if they could have ſwayed in one body as they came to be of one mind, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no ſmall matter, The <hi>King</hi> from the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of cloſe Meetings, ſecret Leagues, ſome Plots of his Nobles, began to forecaſt an apparent ſtorm in the State, and danger to his own Perſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (being both couragious and wiſe) he proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth again a Parliament at <hi>Perth,</hi> where the three Eſtates being aſſembled in his throne of Majeſty, he ſpoke in this manner;</p>
               <p>I have learned from my tender years that Royalty conſiſteth not ſo much in a Chair of State, as in ſuch actions which do well become a prince. What mine have been ſince my coming Home and Government among you, I take firſt God, and then your ſelves for witneſſes. If all of them be not agreeable to you all, and if any rigorous dealing be uſed againſt ſome, Let him who is touched lay aſide his particular, and look to the ſetling of Juſtice in the State, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good of the whole Kingdom, and he ſhall find his ſufferings tolerable, perhaps neceſſary, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the time deſerved. I have endeavoured to take away all Diſcords, aboliſh Factions, Suppreſs Oppreſſion, as no Forein Power hath attempted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:175204:29"/>
ought againſt you hitherto, ſo that ye ſhould not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ought againſt another, nor any thing againſt weal publick and Soveraignty. Slow have I been in puniſhing injuries done to my ſelf, but can hardly pardon ſuch as are done to the Commonwealth, for this have I called this Parliament, let rapine and out-rage no more be heard of, but every man recal himſelf to a civil and regular form of life, eſpecially you (my Nobles) think vertue and civility true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that to be accounted nobleſt which is beſt, and that a mans own worth begets true glory. By theſe and the obedience to their Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors acquired what ye now enjoy, there is no ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger means to keep the goods acquired from a Prince, than the ſame by which they were firſt purchaſed, which is ſtill obeying. Though by leagues, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the confounding of all true Policy and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Government, Man may imagine he can ſhun the Judicatories of Man, let none how great ſoever conceive he can ſave his wrongs unpuniſhed from the Almighty hand of God. Ye muſt not hereafter count Authority, honeſty, and virtue idle names, nor reckon that right which ye may win or hold by dint of Sword. For me, I will behave my ſelf in my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as I muſt anſwer to God, and for you my Subjects do ſo as ye ſhall anſwer to God firſt, and after to your Prince whom God hath ſet over you.</p>
               <p>No mans Greatneſs ſhall appale me in doing right, nor the meanneſs of any make him ſo contemptible that I ſhall not give ear to his grievance; for I will ſtrive to do juſtice on Oppreſſors, and ſupport the innocent to my uttermoſt.</p>
               <p>Here he eaſily found the power which the Preſence of a Prince hath over Subjects; for having confirmed the minds of the Parliament, a mutual oath paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Subjects; The <hi>King</hi> ſwore if any
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175204:29"/>
made war againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> or went about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the ancient Laws of the Kingdom, to reſiſt and invade him with all his power; The <hi>Eſtates</hi> ſwore if any by open Rebellion ſhould revolt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt the <hi>King,</hi> or be found to be the Authors of Factions and Novations, they ſhould aſſiſt and ſide the <hi>King</hi> with all their forces, after what manner he ſhould command. A Solemn Act was made that none of the Subjects ſhould bind up a league toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> the more to aſſure the <hi>Clergy</hi> unto him, ſwore to defend the liberties of the Church, making an Act that all Church lands unjuſtly detained from them, during the time of his Captivity ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto them.</p>
               <p>The Body of the Eſtate holding good for the King, <hi>Mordock</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> with his Sons <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> were preſently arreſted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: as were likewiſe <hi>Duncan</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> and <hi>Robert Graham</hi> (a Man that dared give attempt upon thoſe things which no honeſt man ever could think) they were ſent to <hi>Faulkland,</hi> but the Duke to <hi>Carlaverock. Archembald</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> with <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> the Kings Siſters ſon, <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>March, Walter Oguilby</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but after ſet at liberty. <hi>Adam Hepburn</hi> of <hi>Haylles, Thomas Hay</hi> of <hi>Yeaſter,</hi> with others were ſent to the Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> That ſame day the Duke was Committed, the King ſeized on his Caſtles at <hi>Faulkland</hi> in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and <hi>Down</hi> in <hi>Monteeth,</hi> out of which he removed the Dutcheſs to <hi>Tantallon</hi> in <hi>Lothian.

The Wife of <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> his Brother, with her two ſons <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> a baſe born, haſted with him, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till the reign of King <hi>James</hi> the third.</p>
               <p>The barbarous fierceneſs of <hi>James</hi> highly incenſed the King againſt his Father and race, diverted the current of his Clemency; for when he thought by gentle incarcerations to have reſtrained their malice, now he finds that that deaf Tyrant the <hi>Law</hi> can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure himſelf and bring reſt to his Subjects. Whereupon the year following he calleth a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> at <hi>Sterling,</hi> where the eſtates aſſembling, the Duke with his two ſons and Father-in-law the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> (accuſations being engroſſed, and articles exhibited againſt them out of the acts of former times, of what hath been done unjuſtly, ctuelly or amiſs, during the Kings captivity) were preſented, arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned: <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> being Judge, to whom were adjoyned many noble men and Barons.</p>
               <p>That ſame day on which their fatal ſentence was pronounced, the two young men <hi>Walter Stuart</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Sons to the Duke, were taken forth to the Hill which ariſeth againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and had their heads cut off. The day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mordock</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> late Governour, with <hi>Duncan Lennox</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was beheaded.</p>
               <p>The deaths of theſe Noblemen, were ſo far from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:175204:30"/>
breeding any diſtaſte in the common People, that out of their depraved diſpoſition and envy againſt their betters, they flowted at their fall, reproached their inſolencies, delighted in their execution: and as much without reaſon railed on them when they were dead, as they had flattered them being alive.</p>
               <p>Whether by the wiſdom of the King it hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out, who cauſed aboliſh the Indictment (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt perſons ſo near unto him in blood) or blunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe times, which thought ſuch clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences needed no Records, the particulars of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taindor of theſe great men are ſwallowed up in dark oblivion.</p>
               <p>Moved at the Impriſonment of his Son, did <hi>Mordock</hi> with <hi>Lennox</hi> (hating him whom they had wronged) attempt againſt the Kings perſon, and that ſame very Treaſon which afterwards had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, was it then between the plot, and the execution ſurpriſed, and in the very head cut off? The Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> a man whoſe deſires were both extremely wicked and unbounded, was a great actor in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Did the King, ſtanding in fear of their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary greatneſs, bend his eyes upon the diſpoſition of the Offenders, ſquaring their actions by the rule of their intentions, and weighing what, not how far they did offend? for Princes quickly free themſelves from their very ſhadows in matter of jealouſie of State. And tney have great reaſon to prevent ſuch crimes which cannot be puniſhed when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, nor ſhould they expect to amend a miſchief when the Criminals are become Maſters of their Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
               <p>People believe not that any conjure againſt a Prince, till they find the Treaſon to have taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and diſtruſt the Plot till they ſee him dead. But

the Death of ſuch who are ſuſpected to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of diſorders in a Commonwealth, ſpareth an infinite number of lives, and much civil blood when they are firſt ſurprized, neither are too ſtrict circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Law to be obſerved when a ſmall delay may aboliſh all obſerving of order and Laws.</p>
               <p>The Duke to raiſe his own reputation to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the King with all ſecrecy of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had procured himſelf a vaſt Authority with the Nobles, by a ſemblance of liberality waſting the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of the Crown, as remitting Treaſons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring again Lands annexed to the Crown. He had ſtudied ſo to conciliate to him the minds of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that the deſire of a King did not much touch them, uſing ſuch moderation in his proceedings that his Government ſeemed unto many not only tolerable but deſirable.</p>
               <p>He had eſſayed to draw the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> and had drawn the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> to enter into a League with him, and theſe Noblemen then in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> divided the Nobility and made them break their Allegiance to the King, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which attempt it ſeemeth that that Act of this Kings ſecond Parliament was made. That no Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould league themſelves together.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> eſteemed all that Government of <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Mordock</hi> to be an uſurpation of the Crown, and feared the like thereafter.</p>
               <p>His Son <hi>James</hi> had burnt <hi>Dumbartoun,</hi> and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly killed the Kings Uncle, which was not done without his knowledge, if not his Counſel.</p>
               <p>Though he relieved the <hi>King</hi> of his Captivity, he ſuffered him to remain very long a Priſoner; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he practiſe his deliverance till he perceived the whole States of the Kingdom reſolved to call him Home, and was compelled by the injuries of his own Children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:175204:31"/>To exaſperate new injuries by old rancours, his Father <hi>Robert</hi> ſpurred by Ambition, had famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death the Kings Brother <hi>David</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Faulkland,</hi> to eſcape whoſe Tyrranny, the King yet a child was committed to the protection of ſtranger Princes. What ever the particulars of their accuſations have been, it is above the poſſibility of any Governor, or Man in eminent place and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo to carry himſelf, but a diſcontented Prince, if he will ſet him to a tryal ſhall bring ſome one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his actions to whirl him within compaſs of Juſtice. Thus the imprecation of <hi>Robert</hi> the third took effect upon the race of <hi>Robert</hi> the Governour; for after the death of the Duke of <hi>Rotheſay</hi> he is ſaid to have curſed him moſt deadly, praying as he had ſlain his Brothers Son, and filled their houſe with blood, ſo God would puniſh him, his Stock and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. There is not any wickedneſs, which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not its puniſhment and repentance at the laſt, if we can have patience to attend the laſt act of thoſe Tragedies played on this Theatre of the World. By the Attaindor of the Duke, the Earldoms of <hi>Fife, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teith,</hi> and <hi>Lennox</hi> were devolved to the Crown. The Caſtle of <hi>Inch-Merin</hi> in <hi>Loch-Lommond</hi> which had a while been kept good for <hi>James,</hi> who fled into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by <hi>John Montgomery</hi> and <hi>Humphrey Cunning-</hi> was brought to the obedience of the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Lords and Gentlemen who were in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, attending the Kings pleaſure, underſtood what neceſſary juſtice had been executed upon the Duke and his Sons, they were grievouſly perplexed; yet the King, like a wiſe Phyſitian, would take no more blood then might take away the diſeaſe and all further cauſes of Faction. For within twelve moneths thereafter he ſet them all at Liberty, and received them in his wonted favour, upon promiſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:175204:32"/>
of their loyal demeanour and dutiful obedience in time to come. But being thus freely diſcharged, the conceit was taken that <hi>Mordocks</hi> head and his ſons, with <hi>Lennoxes</hi> was only the aim, and that they were uſed but as a Countenance of State to dazle the eyes of the People. The Wars continuing between the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> the one to keep what he was in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the other to reobtain what he had loſt: <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeventh, a wiſe and Victorious Prince, knowing the Friendſhip of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be of no ſmall importance to any that ſhould fight againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the flower and ſtrength of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which had followed the <hi>French</hi> Wars being then blaſted and ſpent, ſendeth <hi>John Stuart</hi> of <hi>Darnley,</hi> Marſhal of a Gariſon of Horſemen, with the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> (as the <hi>French</hi> write) then Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have a freſh ſupply of Men of Arms, and <hi>Renauld</hi> of <hi>Charters</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheymes,</hi> (who there had Crowned his Maſter, and as Chancellour of <hi>France)</hi> to renew the ancient League between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> But the main buſineſs about which the Archbiſhop came, was the trafficking of a Marriage between <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Daulphine,</hi> though then very young, with <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to King <hi>James.</hi> This Match the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had either neglected or contemn'd, which afterwards they ſued for. the renewing of the old League and Amity betwixt the two Nations was eaſily condeſcended unto, it being but a witneſs to the world of their mutual kindneſs.

               <p>The Marriage being found commodious for both Nations, was likewiſe with great contentment agreed upon, and concluded; freſh recruits of Souldiers were levied, and diſpatched with the Embaſſador to <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>The South and Champion parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> brought under obedience, and a peaceful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the King will have the remoteſt Countries of his Kingdom, even thoſe blocked up and baricado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſnowy Clifts of <hi>Grantsben,</hi> to acknowledge his Juſtice. The wildneſs of the ſoyl had made the Inhabitants there more fierce than Fierceneſs it ſelf, and let them out to all unlawful Riots and Rapines. To reſtrain their inſolent humors and bring them within compaſs of Civility in the year 1426. he cauſed repair the Caſtle of <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> which is ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the uttermoſt borders of <hi>Murray,</hi> and by their incurſions which had been turned deſolate, hither ſome years after cometh he in perſon and keepeth open Court, that being near the evil he might have the better means to provide for and conſider it. But he ſeemed to have arrived in ſome Territory of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> having known and found things which none did nor dare relate unto him, for he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that not many miles off, there were men ſome of which had one thouſand, ſome two thouſand Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at their call, who were accuſtomed to drive preys from the more civil Neighbours and Borders, pilling and ſpoiling, polluting and raviſhing without any

difference of right or wrong, holy or prophane, but only following their ravenous and inſolent humours. On the quieter ſort they ſet Tribute, others they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to Miniſter to them ſuſtenance and neceſſaries: The God, Prince, Law which they obey are their barbarous Chieftains, amongſt which he is thought the beſt who doth moſt tranſcend in Villany.</p>
               <p>The King ſeemed to give ſmall faith to theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, entertaining kindly and feaſting from all parts, all ſuch who daigned to ſee him, moſtly thoſe who were the Chiefs and Principals of the Families in theſe bounds, by whoſe means all whom innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy did guard came freely to Court, and many guilty, by fair promiſes and hopes of the Kings clemency preſented themſelves. Others, though moſt refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and unwilling at firſt, that they might not ſeem out of the faſhion of their Companions, and appear ſuſpect, reſorted thither. Thinking theſe Offices might be interpreted to proceed of good will and obedience, which were done of emulation. Fourty of theſe Leaders and Chiefs, meeting at once and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together within the incloſure of the Caſtle Walls, were ſurprized and committed to cloſe Priſons. Some days after, two whoſe wickedneſs was throughly known, <hi>Alexander Mack-Rore</hi> or <hi>Mackrarey</hi> and <hi>John Mackcarture</hi> were hanged. <hi>James Cambel</hi> for the murther of <hi>John</hi> of the Iſles (renownd amongſt his own) was beheaded. The reſt upon hope of further Tryal were committed to Priſons, of which for example and terror to others many were executed, the remains in peaceful manner ſent home, the King having graciouſly exhorted them to a life according to the Law of God and Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> of the Iſles Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> being taken in this trap was brought by the King to <hi>Perth,</hi> where he was accuſed of oppreſſion, and many barbarous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175204:33"/>
were proved againſt him: yet ſuch was the Kings clemency, he was only ſome few days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and after lovely advice at the Council-Table, rather to obey his Prince than render himſelf Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Thieviſh Troops, he was freely diſmiſt, but benefits oblige not ignoble Minds, and mercy ſhown to a fierce and obſtinate nature diſgraceth the beauty of the clemency of a Prince; for no ſooner was he returned to his own Territories where interpreting impriſonment a diſhonour and ſhame to a Man of his Power and Qualities, and telling that a promiſe made by one impriſoned by the Judgment of Lawyers themſelves was nothing worth, he gathered together a Rabble of Outlaws and Mountainers, came towards the Town of <hi>Innerneſs,</hi> which peaceably he entered and was courteouſly received, having before diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his men among the Fens and Hills toward the Weſt, they, ſo ſoon as Night had brought the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to reſt, ſpoiled them and ſet their houſes on fire. And becauſe the Caſtle was the place in which he had been ſurprized, he beſieged it with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand lewd fellows practiſed in daily depredations and Robberies.</p>
               <p>At the noiſe of this cruelty the Gentlemen of the Neighbouring Shires from all quarters aſſemble themſelves for the defence of their Friends, the <hi>King</hi> liſteth ſpeedy preparations, at the approach of which the Clans, Whattons and Camerons with other Thieving Troups diſperſed themſelves and fled into their lurking holes. <hi>Alexander</hi> abandoned of their Forces with ſo many as he could keep together fled into <hi>Lochquhabar,</hi> from thence paſſed to the Iſles deliberating to go to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but things anſwered not his expectation, for by his Spy finding that he was way-laid, and that numbers of people, (a prize being ſet upon his head) in all places laboured to ſurprize
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:175204:34"/>
him: when he had long continued deſolate, and a vagabond, at laſt he began to intercede with his Friends at Court for Mercy to him from the King. Sundry tempt the Kings Clemency, but he will not promiſe nor aſſure them of any favour before <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> in perſon as Supplyant render himſelf and his eſtate to his diſpoſure. Thus finding no eſcape, and deſtitute of all help he was emboldned to come pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to <hi>Edinbrough;</hi> there on <hi>Eaſter</hi> day wrapped in a mourning Garment, and concealed in the dragg of the multitude, the King being in the Church of the <hi>Holy-rood</hi> at divine Service, he fell proſtrate at his knees, beſeeching him for grace, which at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Queen and other Aſſiſters he obtained. His life and private eſtate was granted him, but that he ſhould do no more harm, and be reduced to a more modeſt behaviour, <hi>William Dowglaſs</hi> earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> was appointed to take him in cuſtody, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtle of <hi>Tantallon;</hi> his Mother <hi>Euphem</hi> Daughter to <hi>Walter Leſly</hi> ſometime Earl of <hi>Roſs</hi> a Manniſh implacable woman, who had ſolicited and raiſed her Son to all that miſchief, was committed to the Iſle of S. <hi>Colm.</hi>

                  <hi>Donald Balloch,</hi> Couſin-germain to <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord of the <hi>Iſles,</hi> a man of a haughty mind, reſenting the Kings proceedings againſt his Couſin, raiſed a great number of Out-laws and Robbers, and invaded <hi>Lochquhabar,</hi> omitting no cruelty, which enraged Savages uſe to commit. <hi>Alexander Stuart,</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> and <hi>Alane</hi> Earl of <hi>Caithneſs,</hi> with ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People as they could in haſt raiſe, came to defend the Country againſt the incurſions of theſe Highland men, and rencountred them at <hi>Innerlochty,</hi> where by an over-weening opinion of Victory, which eaſily deceiveth young Souldiers, imagining they went to fight with untrained, raw Theeves, who
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:175204:34"/>
would never abide their march, and miſregard of martial Diſcipline, <hi>Allan</hi> was ſlain, and <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre</hi> diſcomfited, and <hi>Balloch</hi> inſolent of his Victory, with a great Booty returned to the Iſles. The King at the Rumour of this diſaſter in all celerity with a great Army came to <hi>Dunſtaffage,</hi> intending from that to paſs to the Iſles, which when the Clans and other chief men underſtood, turning their defence into ſubmiſſion, they came in haſt to <hi>Dunſtaffage,</hi> and humbly begg'd pardon: laying the fault of the whole Rebellion on <hi>Balloch,</hi> and ſome adventuring Thieves, many of which <hi>Balloch</hi> had preſſed to that miſchief againſt their minds; the King finding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream rigour at that time a cure unreaſonable, taking their oath of fidelity, and that they ſhould perſue <hi>Balloch</hi> and his followers, accepted them in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, only tranſporting ſome of the moſt factious along with him. They in few days, to ſeem worthy of the Kings mercy, ſurprized a great number of them, three hundred of which died all on Gibbets; and puniſhment had taken away a much greater number, had he not conſidered that there is no man ſo miſerable, who is not a member of the State.</p>
               <p>The King, leſt hope of impunity might cheriſh Rebellion, reſolves to find <hi>Balloch,</hi> and hearing he lurked in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the bounds of one named <hi>Odo,</hi> he ſends to have him delivered; <hi>Odo,</hi> either out of fear of the Kings diſpleaſure, or hope of rewards, ſeizeth on him; and ſuſpecting if he ſent him alive, he might by power or ſtratagem ſlight his Convoy, chopping off his head, and ſent it to King <hi>James,</hi> then remaining at <hi>Sterling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Clans, Whattons, and Camerons, ſpairing the Magiſtrates ſword, yet executing Juſtice by mutual ſlaughters one of another, had rendred the North very peaceable of that ſcum of Thieves: ſome Chieftains
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:175204:35"/>
were ſhut up in faſt Priſons, among which two moſt eminent in all miſchiefs, hating mortally others, and hated of all good men, <hi>Angus Duff</hi> of <hi>Strath-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi> and <hi>Angus Murray;</hi> theſe the King out of Policy of State let out and ſet at liberty, of purpoſe that they might be thruſt forward in a greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Returning to their wild countries <hi>Duff,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſpecting the Kings clemency, accompanied with many Thieves and Robbers, driveth a great prey of cattle and other ſpoils from the Confines of <hi>Murray</hi> and <hi>Caithneſs;</hi> which to recover, <hi>Angus Murray,</hi> that he might attempt ſomething worthy of his life and liberty, followeth with a great power of like Souldiers; having now Authority to juſtifie his revenge on a guilty enemy, he overtaketh <hi>Duff</hi> near unto <hi>Strath-Navern;</hi> There ſtrongly is it fought, neither of the parties being inferiour to other in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cruelty, or deſpair. This conflict continued ſo fierce and eager, that of both ſides there remained ſcarce twelve perſons alive, and thoſe ſo wounded that Juſtice had not whom to purſue. An over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw delightful and commodious for the peace and quiet of all the honeſt and vertuous Subjects of theſe Countries.</p>
               <p>Theſe many executions nothing appalled one <hi>Mac-Donald,</hi> born in <hi>Roſs,</hi> a Thief fleſht in all murthers, miſchievous without mercy, equally greedy of blood and ſpoil, who by Robberies had acquired great riches. Amongſt other cruelties, he is ſaid to have naild horſe-ſhoes to the ſoles of a Widow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in her grief ſhe had ſworn in haſt to report his wickedneſs to the King. Being brought to <hi>Perth</hi> by men of his own qualities, with twelve of his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, the King cauſed them in like manner to be ſhod as they had ſerved the woman; and when three days, for a ſpectacle to the people, they had been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:175204:35"/>
hurried along the Town, his companions were Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beted, and he made ſhorter by the head.</p>
               <p>Groſs enormities cut away, factions repreſſed, the <hi>King</hi> maketh a Progreſs throughout all the parts of his Realm, doing Juſtice upon all ſorts of Male-factors; neither did Pardons granted by the late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour avail, it being alledged, that they expired by his death; and though ſmall faults might have been paſſed by ſuch remiſſions, yet horrible and crying crimes were not within the compaſs of ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Whileſt he thus continues in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Juſtice, the favourable eye of Providence look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon him, and in the year 1430. in the moneth of <hi>October,</hi> Queen <hi>Jane</hi> is delivered of two Sons at <hi>Holy-Rood-Houſe, Alexander</hi> and <hi>James;</hi> the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed in his infancy, the other ſucceeded to his Father and was King.

Laws) had many years continued in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; theſe he will either have aboliſhed or amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; To this effect, he ſelecteth perſons commended for wiſdom, gravity and uprightneſs of life through his Realm, to pry into all abuſes, hear and determine of all ſorts of quarrels and ſuits, if any were brought unto them, whereof the ordinary Judges, either for fear dared not, or power of ſtronger could not, or for hatred or favour would not give any perfect Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. To them he gave full Authority to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the breach of poenal Statutes; ſome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were puniſhed by Fines, others in their Lives; he took away the deceit which had been occaſioned by variety of meaſures; for this end certain Iron mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were appointed to be made, unto which the reſt ſhould be conform and like; before his Reign not only in every Town and Shire, but in every Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and Houſe different meaſures were currant, which abuſe he aboliſhed by Parliament.</p>
               <p>The roughneſs of the times, and perpetual wars and troubles of his Anceſtors had near taken away the Arts and Handycrafts, and turned the Sciences contemptible, eſpecially ſince the Reign of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the third. The Commons by the manifold chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and miſeries of the Age affecting Barbarity, the Nobles making Arms their whole ſtudy and care; to the further advancement of the Commonwealth, and that his Subjects might have occaſion to avoid ſloth and idleneſs, the King from the Neighbour Continent, and from <hi>England</hi> drew unto him the beſt Artizans and Manufactors, whom either large priviledges or moneys could entice and oblige. Of which ſuch a fair number came, and were ſo graciouſly received, that they forgot their Native Countreys, and here made their perpetual abode. And what till this day <hi>Scotland</hi> enjoyeth of them, owe all their beginning
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:175204:36"/>
to theſe Times. Schools of learning were founded, to which great Liberties and Priviledges were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the King well knowing that what ever is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in any Eſtate, from them had beginning and ſeed, and that there is no better means to ſweeten and tame the wild nature of Men then to buſie their ſpirits with peaceful and ſedentary Exerciſes; rude and untrained minds being inclinable of themſelves to tumult and ſedition. To make a neceſſity of learning, he made an Act that none of the Nobility ſhould ſucceed to their Anceſtors Heritage, except they had ſome taſte of the Civil Law or practice of the Country-Cuſtoms, but this after was by them aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>Many famous men in all Sciences from the Nobleſt Univerſities of Chriſtendom came hither, as to the Sanctuary of the Muſes, where often the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon graced their Leſſons, and when great matters did not withdraw him, was Umpire to their harmleſs Conflicts. Being himſelf religious, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Men learned and of good life to eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Church; and that the beſt deſervers might be diſcerned he diſtinguiſhed the learned in degrees, Making a Law that none ſhould enjoy the room of a Canon in any Cathedral Church, unleſs he were Batchelour in Divinity, or at the leaſt of the Canon Law. Though he challenged King <hi>David</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him a grievous Saint to the Crown, for dilapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating ſo much Rent in extraordinary Donations to the Church, yet with great coſt and magnificence he founded the Convent of <hi>Charters</hi> in <hi>Perth,</hi> and beſtowed fair Revennues upon it: The excellent skill which he had in Muſick and delight in <hi>Poeſie</hi> made him affect Quiriſters, and he was the firſt that erected in his own Chappels, and the Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Organs, being not much known before his Reign to the Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:175204:37"/>Peace hath its own dangers no leſs than Wars, yea often ſuch eſtates as have encreaſed their Dominions, and became mighty by Wars, have found their ruin in a luxurious peace: Men by a voluptuous life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming leſs ſenſible of true honour. The Court, and by that example, the Country was become too ſoft and delicate, ſuperfluous in all delights and pleaſures. Maſques, Banqueting, gorgeous apparel, revelling were not only licenſed, but ſtudied and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired: Nothing did pleaſe what was not ſtrange and far brought, Charity began to be reſtrained, publique magnificence falling in private Riot. What was wont to entertain whole Families, and a train of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, was now ſpent in dreſſing of ſome little rooms, and the womanniſh decking of the perſons of ſome few <hi>Hermophradites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe the wiſe King had a while given way, knowing that delicate ſoft times were more eaſie to be governed, and a people given to mild arts, and a ſweet condition of life, than rough and barbarous, ſo they turned not altogether womanized: and that it was an eaſie matter to bring them back again to their old poſture. At theſe abuſes ſome of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer ſort of the Clergy began to carp, yet could they not challenge the Prince, who in the entertainment of his own perſon, ſcarce exceeded the degree of any private Man, yea was often under the Pomp and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of a King: But the blemiſh of all this exceſs was laid on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who by the Queen (their Country woman) with new guiſes daily reſorted hither, and turned new-fangle the Court. The King not only liſtened to their plaints, but called a Parliament to ſatisfie their humours. Here <hi>Henry Wardlaw</hi> Biſhop of S. <hi>Andrews,</hi> highly aggravating the abuſes and ſuperfluities of Court and Country, all diſorders were pry'd into, and Statutes made
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175204:37"/>
againſt them. They aboliſhed Riots of all ſorts of Pearl (many Rivers in <hi>Scotland</hi> affording them not only for uſe but for exceſs) only women were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to wear a ſmall Carkanet of them about their Necks; coſtly Furs and Ermins were wholly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, together with the abuſe of Gold and Silver lace. Penalties were not only impoſed upon the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours, but on workmen which ſhould make or ſell them; exceſſive expenſe in banqueting was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and dainties baniſhed from the Tables of <hi>Epicures,</hi> with Jeaſters and Buffons. In this year 1430. the firſt of <hi>June</hi> was a terrible <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> at three of the clock afternoon, the day turning black for the ſpace of an half hour, as though it had been Night; therefore it was after called of the Commons, The BLACK HOUR.</p>
               <p>The laſt and greateſt matter which buſied the Kings thoughts, was, the encreaſing of his Revenues, and bringing back the Demeſn of the Crown: a work no leſs dangerous than deep and difficil, and which at laſt procured him greateſt hatred. For till then ſmothered malice did never burſt forth in open flames. And though this diligence of the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned much the publick weal, yet ſuch as were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed by rendring what they had long poſſeſſed (though without all reaſon) eſteemed themſelves highly wronged. The Patrimony of the Crown had been waſted and given away by the two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, to keep themſelves popular, and ſhun the envy of a factious Nobility; Thus the King had neither in magnificence to maintain himſelf, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon his friends or ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>He had adviſedly peruſed all evidences and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters belonging to the Crown; hereupon he recalls all ſuch Lands as had been either alienated from it, or wrongfully uſurped.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:175204:38"/>Together what was wont to be idly given away, as forfeitures eſcheats and wards, were reſtrained to the Crown and kept to the King himſelf.</p>
               <p>There remained upon conſiderations of encreaſing the Demeſns of the Crown, the Lands of the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> whoſe Father had rebelled againſt the Kings Father <hi>Robert;</hi> though faults be perſonal, and not hereditary and the heirs of ancient houſes hold little of their laſt poſſeſſours, but of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, thoſe the King ſeized on. The Earl pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by good evidences and writings brought forth, his Father had been pardoned for that fault by the Regents of the Kingdom; he was anſwered again, that it was not in the Regents power to pardon an offence againſt the State, and that it was expreſly provided by the Laws in crimes of <hi>Leſe Majeſty,</hi> That children ſhould undergo puniſhment for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tranſgreſſions, to the end that being thus heirs to their Fathers raſhneſs, as they are to their Goods and Lands, they ſhould not at any time with vaſt ambition in the haughty Pride of their own Power, plot or practiſe to ſhake and tear the Publick Peace of the Prince and Country.</p>
               <p>Thus was the remiſſion by the Parliament declared void, and <hi>Earl George</hi> himſelf committed to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle at <hi>Edenbrough, William Earl</hi> of <hi>Anguſs</hi> Warden of the Middle March, <hi>William Creightoun</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, Sir <hi>Adam Hepburn</hi> of <hi>Hailles</hi> immediately received the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> the keeping of which was given to Sir <hi>Adam Hepburn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King not long after ſet <hi>Earl George</hi> at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to ſave him from the like dangers which were wont to befall his Predeceſſours (to fly into <hi>England</hi> for every ſmall croſs and light diſpleaſure at Court) he beſtowed on him, as it were in exchange, for theſe lands in the <hi>Marſs,</hi> the Earldom of <hi>Buchan</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:175204:38"/>
in the North, with a yearly penſion to be paid out of the Earldom of <hi>March,</hi> ſetting the <hi>Tay</hi> and the <hi>Forth</hi> betwixt him and his too kind friends of <hi>England. Buchan</hi> had faln to the King by the deceaſe of <hi>John</hi> who was Son to <hi>Robert</hi> the ſecond and <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan,</hi> he was ſlain at <hi>Vernveill</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> with the Marſhal <hi>Duglaſs,</hi> and left no lawful children after him to ſucceed. The <hi>Earldom</hi> of <hi>Marre</hi> was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate alſo to the Demeſn Royal by the deceaſe of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Marre,</hi> who was natural Son to <hi>Alexander Stuart</hi> who was the Son of <hi>Robert</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. He was a Man of ſingular proweſs, and in his youth followed the Wars under <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> he married <hi>Jane</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> and had greatly obliged his Country by tranſporting Stallions and Mares hither out of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> the Stood of which continued long after to his commendation and the commodity of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>The Earldom of <hi>Strathern</hi> was appropriated alſo to the Crown by the Deceaſe of <hi>David Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> Uncle to the King, who having but one only Daughter (who was married to <hi>Patrick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a younger brother of the Lord <hi>Grahams</hi>) the <hi>Earldom</hi> being tailed to the Maſculine Line was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved again to the Crown. Thus did King <hi>James</hi> ſucceed to three Brothers who were Sons to <hi>Robert</hi> the Second.</p>
               <p>All good men with theſe proceedings of the King were well pleaſed; for if Princes could keep their own, and that which juſtly belongeth unto them, they could not be urged to draw ſuch extraordinary Subſidies from the blood, ſweat, and tears of their people; yet was this the Shelf on which this Prince periſhed: for, many who were accuſtomed to be co-partners of ſuch off-fallings, began to ſtorm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:175204:39"/>
at his actions, but none was ſo implacable as <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> Uncle and Tutor to <hi>Miles Graham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Euphem,</hi> daughter to <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Strathern.</hi> For plotting miſchief he began to rail, ſpeak in high terms, aſſociate himſelf with others of his own mind. Notwithſtanding that the King <hi>Anno</hi> 1428. in <hi>September</hi> had beſtowed on his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew the Lands and Earldom of <hi>Monteeth</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of that of <hi>Strathern,</hi> to which he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed right, it being an appenage of the Crown.</p>
               <p>About this time Embaſſadors came into <hi>Scotland</hi> from <hi>Ericus</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> requiring of King <hi>James</hi> the payment of a yearly Tribute, which was due to him as King of <hi>Norway</hi> for the Weſtern Iſles, according to the Covenant and Agreement made by <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and his Predeceſſor <hi>Magnus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Acho,</hi> then King of <hi>Norway;</hi> the Embaſſador was honourably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Sir <hi>William Creighton</hi> Chancellor, directed to go with him to <hi>Denmark,</hi> who there renewed the old League between the Realms, ſetled queſtionable matters, and confirmed a perfect amity and ſtedfaſt Peace.</p>
               <p>Embaſſadors came alſo from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, not only to confirm the old Amity between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but for a better aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to have <hi>Margaret</hi> eldeſt Daughter to King <hi>James</hi> (already betrothed to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> who now was thirteen years of Age) delivered to them and convoyed to <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> foreknowing this Alliance, had before ſent the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> with other Aſſociates to him in Embaſſage, to have the old League between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> diſſolved, and to joyn the Kings Daughter in marriage with <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth their King; promiſing if the King would thereunto agree, and joyn in League with
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:175204:39"/>
them, that the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Berwick</hi> ſhould be delivered to the Power of the <hi>Scots,</hi> with all the Lands lying between <hi>Tweed</hi> and the <hi>Redcroſs,</hi> which when <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour granted <hi>Cumberland</hi> to the <hi>Scots,</hi> marched <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and is now a fragment of a Croſs in <hi>Richmond</hi>-ſhire, neer the Spittle on <hi>Stanmoor</hi> about which is nothing but a wild deſert.</p>
               <p>Having Audience, the Lord <hi>Scroop</hi> ſpake before the Council to this purpoſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am directed hither by my Maſter and his Council about a buſineſs which concerneth the Honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the two Kingdoms, above any other which can be projected; and it is the eſtabliſhing of a perpetual Peace and Concord between them, and happily (when it ſhall pleaſe the higher Providence) their uniting in one Body, under one Prince, one day. How vain the attempting of this heretofore by Arms hath proved, the world can but too well bear witneſs; the many proofs of eithers valour againſt themſelves having been but a laviſh effuſion of humane Blood; the faireſt way, the eaſieſt means to make enmities ceaſe and theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Quarrels, was begun. Sir, in your Perſon, by the happy Marriage of the Daughter of</hi> John <hi>Duke of</hi> Somerſet, <hi>brother to King</hi> Henry <hi>the fourth, and Son to the Duke of</hi> Lancaſter; <hi>and proſperouſly hath continued theſe years paſt: Now the Peace may be laſting, and the affections and minds of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſoldered together: Our Requeſt is, that this Alliance may be again renewed, by the Marriage of your eldeſt Daughter with our young King, a moſt fitting and equal match. And in ſeeking of her, we crave but our own; She is deſcended of our Royal Stem, and if again ſhe be ingrafted in that ſtock out
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:175204:40"/>
of which ſhe ſprang, it is but natural. And you (my Lords) where can ye find a Match more Honourable for both Nations? Where can ye find a better and more profitable friendſhip than Ours? Are we not a people inhabiting one Iſland, have we not both one Language, are we not of like Habit and Faſhion, of like quality and condition of Life, guarded and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the other World by the great depths of the Ocean? What evil Cuſtoms have come into your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by your laſt Allyance with us? Nay, what Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Policy, and laudable Faſhions (to the confuſion of Barbarity) have not followed hereupon? By this the Glory of both Realms will encreaſe, either being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient not only to furniſh neceſſaries, but even all lawful and moderate contentments of life to ſupport others. Beſides that, an aſſurance of Defence, Strength, and Power to invade, eaſe in undergoing publick Charges will hereby follow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We are not ignorant that your Lady is deſigned for</hi> France; <hi>but how long (alaſs) will ye continue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of your blood for the</hi> French? <hi>What have ye advantaged your ſelves by your Alliance with</hi> France, <hi>ſave that they engage your bodies in their Wars, and by conferring upon you unprofitable titles of honour, take from you what is truly real? ye are reſerved a Poſtern-gate, by which they may enter</hi> England, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting our Forces, and tranſporting the Stage of the War upon our Borders. Learn to forget your</hi> French, <hi>or if ye be ſo enamoured with</hi> France, <hi>love her after our manner, come take a ſhare, be partakers of our Victories. Are not our Forces being joyned, ſufficient to overcome, nay, bring in chains hither that King of</hi> Bruges, <hi>and make our ſelves Maſters of his Continent?</hi> France <hi>never did ſo much good to</hi> Scotland <hi>in twenty years, as</hi> Scotland <hi>hath had loſs by</hi> England <hi>for the love and cauſe of</hi> France <hi>in one. Are not your
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175204:40"/>
wounds at</hi> Vernueil <hi>and</hi> Cravant <hi>yet bleeding, and all for the</hi> French? <hi>It hath been your valour, and not the</hi> French <hi>which heretofore empeached our conqueſt and progreſs in</hi> France: <hi>were it not for your ſwords, we had made ere now the loftieſt tops of the</hi> Alps <hi>or</hi> Pyrenees <hi>bear our Trophies. Ye ſay ye reverence, and cannot break your old League and confederation with that Kingdom (happy Leagues, but wo to the keepers of them!) unhappy</hi> Scotland, <hi>and too too honeſt; and the more unhappy, for that thy honeſty is the great cauſe of thy miſhaps. How long ſhall that old League (counted amongſt the Fables of the Ancient</hi> Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines) <hi>make you waſte your lives, goods, fortunes, and loſe your better Friends? The Genius of this Iſle ſeemeth to cry unto us her Nurſelings to ſtay our cruel hands, no longer to be her deſolation, and the wrack one of another; not to paſs over and neglect theſe fair occaſions of mutual Alliances, which will not only effectuate Truces and Leagues amongſt our ſelves, but at laſt bring a perpetual Peace and Union; for by interchange of Marriages (being united) this Iſle ſhall continue ſtronger by entertaining Peace and Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then by all theſe Giant walls, Rampiers of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and that huge ditch of Seas, by which Nature hath environed and fortified her. Now that he may know how dearly we eſteem your friendſhip and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whereas others go to take from you, we will give you</hi> Roxburgh, Berwick, <hi>and all the Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Tweed <hi>and</hi> Redcroſs. <hi>If ſhadows prevail and prove ſtronger with you than eſſential reaſon, and that ye diſeſteem our offer, loſing this good occaſion; we as Neighbours and Friends entreat you, that ye do not uphold the</hi> French, <hi>now in the Sun-ſet of their Fortunes, and at their weakeſt; that ye would not ſhoulder this falling wall; but that ye would live quiet within your ſelves, keeping your own in a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:175204:41"/>
receiving both ſides,</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Engliſh <hi>in the way of Friendſhip, neither ſide in the way of Faction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> French Embaſſadour <hi>ſpoke to this purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>It ſeemeth ſtrange to me that it ſhould be queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fall within the Circle of deliberation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old, ever true and aſſured Friends; or old, never truſted, and only Enemies, ſhould in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſuit be preferred: whether ye ſhould ſtand to a Nation which in your greateſt calamities ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abandoned you, or embrace and be carried away with one which hath ever ſought your overthrow. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſue for your alliance and friendſhip, but it is to make you leave your old Confederates, and turn the inſtruments of their ruine, and at laſt bring the yoke of bondage upon your ſelves. The <hi>French</hi> ſue for your friendſhip and alliance, both to ſupport themſelves and hold ſervitude from you; were not your friendſhip with <hi>France,</hi> their power, policy, and number had long ere theſe days over-turned your Realm; or had <hi>France</hi> but ſhown her ſelf an indifferent Arbitreſs, of the blows between <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> ye had ſcarce till now kept your Name, leſs your Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; can ye prove ſo ungrateful as not to ſupply them who ſupported you? Can ye prove ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, after ſo many glorious wounds received in the defence of <hi>France,</hi> as cowardly to turn your backs upon her in her greateſt need, defacing all the Traces of your former Fame and Glory? with what countenances could ye look upon thoſe <hi>Scots,</hi> which at <hi>Vernueill</hi> and <hi>Cravant</hi> in the Bed of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour left their lives; if unrevenged ye ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here and joyn your ſelves to their Enemies and Killers? Now though ye would forſake the <hi>French,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:175204:41"/>
at this time intangled in many difficulties, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their well being, nor be ſolicitous of their ſtanding: at leaſt be careful of your own.</p>
                  <p>It cannot ſubſiſt with your well and ſafety, to ſuffer a bordering Nation, always at enmity with you, to ariſe to that height and power by ſuch an addition as is the Kingdom of <hi>France:</hi> ſo ſoon as a State hath a Neighbour ſtrong, enough and able to ſubdue it, it is no more to be eſteemed a free Eſtate. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are already become ſo Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that no leſs than united forces of neighbour Kingdoms will ſerve to ſtop the current of their fortune. Neglect not the certain love of the <hi>French,</hi> your often tryed and ancient friends, for the uncertain friendſhip and within a little time, forgotten Alliances of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> your late recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Enemies.</p>
                  <p>But it may be, after mutual marriages have one day joyned your two Kingdoms in one, they will ſeek no preheminency over your State, nor make thrall your Kingdom, but be knit up with you in a perfect union: Do not ſmall brooks loſe their names when they commix their Streams with mighty Rivers, and are not Rivers ingolfed when they mingle their waters with the Seas? Ye enjoy now a kind of mixed Government (my Lords) not living under abſolute Soveraignty; your King proceedeth with you more by Prayers and Requeſts than by Precepts and Commandments, and is rather your Head than Soveraign, as ruling a Nation not conquered: But when ye ſhall be joyned in a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with that Kingdom which is abſolutely Royal and purely Monarchical, having long ſuffered the Laws of a Conquerour, ye ſhall find a change and a terrible transformation. The free managing of your own affairs ſhall be taken from you; Laws,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:175204:42"/>
Magiſtracies. Honours ſhall depend on them, the wealth of your Kingdom ſhall be transferred to theirs; which to obey and proſtrate your ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, if ye be found ſtubborn, ye ſhall ſuffer as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Conquered, be redacted in a Province, have Deputies and Governours ſet over you, Garriſons in your ſtrongeſt holds and Caſtles, and by a calm of Peace and Union receive more fearful blowes than ye could have ſuffered by any Tempeſt of War; The miſeries of a moſt lamentable Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. What courteſie can ye expect at their hands, who contrary to all divine and human Laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained your King eighteen years priſoner, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an exorbitant Ranſom (as if he had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a lawful war) did not without Hoſtages ſend him home? We of <hi>France</hi> did never forſake you in your extremities, and we expect ye will aſſiſt us with all your power. They are in ſuit of your Daughter, but it is long after ſhe was aſſured unto us; in claiming her, we claim but our own, this time paſt ye have only had the cuſtody and education of her, yet if they be ſo ambitious of your Alliance, God hath bleſſed you with more than this. But it is not that which they ſue for, it is to make you diſclaim your Friends, hate thoſe which love you, and love them which hate you: and they are working upon you as a rude unpoliſht people.

               <p>The King and Nobles though it ſeemed more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the preſent time to follow the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (weighing their offers) yet held it more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſure for coming times, to follow the <hi>French,</hi> for if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould make conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> the Conqueſt of <hi>Scotland</hi> would ſcarce be one Months work to their power? and for matter of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance, God knows how little Princes regard it, when occaſion is offered to enlarge their power and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

               <p>The King was ſo far from being moved by theſe threatnings, that immediately he made ready his Ships, and knowing more affairs to be brought to a good end and finiſhed by the opportunity occaſions

Henry Piercy</hi> of <hi>Northumberland</hi> invadeth the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with four thouſand men; whether of his own bravery, abhorring eaſe and idlenes, or that he had a Commiſſion ſo to do, is uncertain, with him came Sir <hi>Henry Cliddeſdale,</hi> Sir <hi>John Ogle, Richard Piercy,</hi> and many men of choice and worth, the frontier Garriſons invade all places near unto them. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt theſe incurſions <hi>William Dowglaſs</hi> Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs</hi> getteth charge, a man reſembling his Anceſtors in all vertues either of War or Peace, and the moſt eminent of his time: with him went <hi>Adam Hepburn</hi> of <hi>Hailes, Alexander Elphinſtoun</hi> of <hi>Elphinſtoun</hi> in <hi>Lothian,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Ramſey</hi> of <hi>Dalhowſie,</hi> of all being Four thouſand ſtrong.

The Liſts of their meeting was <hi>Popperden,</hi> a place not far from <hi>Bramſtoun, Rhodam, Roſeden, Eglingham,</hi> all cheared with the ſtream of a ſmall Brook, named <hi>Crammiſh,</hi> which ariſing out of the <hi>Cheviot,</hi> loſeth its name in the <hi>Till,</hi> as the <hi>Till</hi> after many windings diſgorgeth it ſelf in the <hi>Tweed.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:175204:44"/>
between the <hi>Scots</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in an open field. When the Fight with equal order had been long maintained on both ſides, now the <hi>Scots,</hi> then the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> yielding ground, many of the Commanders at length began to fall, moſt of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Then was the <hi>Piercy</hi> conſtrained to be at once Commander and Souldier, but ere he could be heard ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies had turned their backs, among the thickeſt throngs of which breaking in, he found ſo great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that neither by Authority, Intreaty or Force he was able to ſtay their flying. Thus diſtracted between the two courſes of honour and ſhame, he is hurried far from the place of Fight: And Victory declared her ſelf altogether for the <hi>Scots;</hi> which was not ſo great in the execution, as in the death and captivity of ſome brave men. Of the <hi>Scots,</hi> Two hundred Gentlemen and common Souldiers were ſlain, amongſt which was <hi>Alexander Elphinſtoun,</hi> maintaining the Battel with his ſword, voice and wounds, and two other Knights.

               <p>The King irritated by the way-laying of his Daughter, the Invading of his Borders, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged not a little by this little ſmile of Fortune at <hi>Popperden,</hi> it being more ſure to prevent than repel dangers, and with the ſame Policies to defend by which the Enemies offend, reſolveth by open Wars to Invade <hi>England.</hi> He was alſo ſtirred unto this by his intelligence from his friends in <hi>France,</hi> who had brought greater matters to paſs then in ſo ſhort a time could have been expected; for concealed envy and old malice, burſting out between <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>Sommerſet, Philip</hi>

Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> being entred in friendſhip with King <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began to be daily loſers, and were put out of <hi>Paris</hi> and many Towns of <hi>France.</hi> To this effect King <hi>James</hi> having raiſed an Army cometh to <hi>Roxburgh</hi> (a place fatal to his) and there beſiegeth the Caſtle of <hi>Marchmond,</hi> which is <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> it was valiantly defended by Sir <hi>Ralph Gray:</hi> but when he was come ſo near the end of his labours that they within the Caſtle were driven to terms of Agreement and conditions for giving up the Fort, the Queen in great haſte cometh to the Camp, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to her Husband a Conſpiracy, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the peril of which, if it were not ſpeedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, ſhould endanger his Eſtate, Perſon, and Race. Whether ſhe had any inckling of the Conſpiracy indeed, or contrived this to divert his Forces from the Aſſault, and further harm of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> her Friends and Countreymen, it is uncertain. The King who found his imagination wounded upon this point, after many doubtful reſolutions and conflicts in his thoughts, raiſeth the Siege, disbandeth the Army, and accompanied with ſome choſen Bands of his moſt aſſured Friends returned back, to provide for his own ſafety. A ſtrange reſolution, to disband an Army for a tale of Treaſon; where could there be greater ſafety for a King than in an Army? Yet have Conſpiracies been often in Camps, and in his own time, <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> brother to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>York, Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Scroope,</hi> with Sir <hi>Thomas Gray,</hi> at the inſtigation of the <hi>Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> for a great ſum of money conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Murder <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>England,</hi> in the midſt of his Armies, if they had not been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed. The King feared all, becauſe he had not yet heard the names of any, but moſt the Army, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Nobility, many of which, who liked not
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:175204:45"/>
the preſent form of Government, were irritated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Were the Conſpiracy a Rebellion, and in general by them all, they were ready in Arms to maintain their Factions, and if upon ſuſpicion the King ſhould attach any (being ſecretly joyned in a League) He could hardly have medled with their perſons, without a Civil War, which in regard of his Engagement with <hi>England</hi> he endeavoured to ſpare; perplexed, penſive, ſad, he cometh to <hi>Perth,</hi> ſtayeth in the Covent of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> named the <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friers</hi> (a place not far from the Town Wall) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring ſo ſecretly as was poſſible to find out the Conſpiracy. But his cloſe practiſing was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Conſpirators, as that there was more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril to reſolve than execute a Treaſon, a diſtance of time between the Plot and execution, diſcovering and overthrowing the enterpriſe: Hereupon they determine to hazard on the miſchief, before tryal or remedy could be thought upon.</p>
               <p>The Conſpirators were <hi>Robert Graham,</hi> Uncle and Tutor to <hi>Miles Graham, Robert Stuart,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew to <hi>Walter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and one of the Kings ſworn Domeſticks: But he who gave motion to all, was the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> himſelf, the Kings Fathers Brother, whoſe quarrel was no leſs then a pretended title and claim to the Crown; which he formed and alledged thus. His Brother <hi>David</hi> and he were procre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by King <hi>Robert</hi> the Second on his firſt Wife <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme Roſs</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought and ſhould have been preferred to the ſucceſſion of the Crown, before King <hi>John</hi> (named <hi>Robert</hi>) and all the Race of <hi>Elizabeth Moor,</hi> who was but his ſecond wife, and next them but Heirs to King <hi>Robert</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>They were the eldeſt ſons of King <hi>Robert</hi> after he was King, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> being born when he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:175204:45"/>
was but in a private State, and Earl of <hi>Strathern;</hi> for it would appear, that as a Son born after his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath loſt his Kingdom, is not eſteemed for the Son of a King, ſo neither he that is born before the Father be a King. Theſe reaſons he thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the King taken away, to ſet him in the room of State. But conſidered not how ſacred the name of a King is to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation; how a Crown once worn quite taketh away what defects ſoever: and that it was not eaſie to diveſt a King in preſent poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Crown, who had his right from his Father and Grandfather, with the Authority of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, approving his Deſcent, and ſecluding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; leſs came it in his thought, that thoſe children are Legitimate, and lawful which cannot be thruſt back and rejected, without troubling the common Peace of the Country, and opening Gates to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Invaſions, Domeſtical diſturbances, and all diſorders, with an unſetled courſe of Succeſſion: the common Errour making the Right or Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athol</hi> animated by the Oracle of a Sooth-ſayer of his Highland Country, who had aſſured him he ſhould be crowned in a Solemn Aſſembly before his Death, never gave over his hopes of obtaining the Crown: and being inferiour and weak in power and faction to the other Brothers, to compaſs his deſigns he betaketh himſelf to treacherous devices. It was not in his power to ruine ſo many at once; for miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief required there ſhould be diſtance between ſo many bloody Acts, therefore he layeth his courſe for the taking away of his kindred one by another at leaſure; he ſoweth jealouſies, entertaineth diſcords, maintaineth factions amongſt them; by his counſel <hi>David</hi> Duke of <hi>Rotheſay</hi> the Kings eldeſt Brother was famiſhed in the Tower of <hi>Falkland,</hi> neither had <hi>James</hi> (then a child) eſcaped his treachery, if far off
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:175204:46"/>
in <hi>England</hi> he had not been preſerved: He perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Earl of <hi>Fife,</hi> that, making out of the way the King his Brother, he ſhould put the Crown on his own head: He trafficked the return of King <hi>James,</hi> and he being come, he plotted the overthrow of Duke <hi>Mordock,</hi> by fit Inſtrument for ſuch a buſineſs, proving the Crimes laid againſt him in the Attaindor, he himſelf ſat Judge againſt him, and his Children. Thus ſtirring one of the Kinſmen againſt another, he ſo enfeebled the Race of <hi>Elizabeth Moor,</hi> that of a numerous off-ſpring there only remained <hi>James</hi> and his Son (a childe not yet ſix years of Age) upon whoſe Sepulchers building his deſigns, with a ſmall alteration of the State he thought it an eaſie ſtep to the Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Graham</hi> had been long impriſoned, at laſt releaſed; but being a man implacable once offended, and cruel, whom neither buſineſs could oblige, nor dangers make wiſe, an enemy to Peace, Factious and Ambitious alike, by many wicked Plots afterwards, and Crimes againſt the Laws of the Country driven to an Out-lawry, and to live as baniſhed; he had ever a male-talent againſt the King ſince the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging of the Earldom of <hi>Strathern</hi> from his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Miles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> was very familiar with the King, and his acceſs to his Chamber and Perſon advanced the Enterpriſe: being a riotous young man, gaping after great matters, neither reſpecting Faith nor Fame, and daring attempt any thing for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of his own fooliſh hopes, and his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers aims and ambition. Theſe having aſſociated unto them the moſt audacious, whom either fear of puniſhment for their miſdeeds, or hopes of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a change of the Government would plunge into any enterpriſe; in the moneth of <hi>February</hi> ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:175204:46"/>
ſecretly as was poſſible, aſſembled together, where the Earl ſpake to this ſenſe unto them.</p>

                  <hi>The ſtrange Tragedies which in the State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have been enacted, ſince the coming of this</hi> Engliſh <hi>man to the Crown, are to none of you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known:</hi> Mordock <hi>with his children hath been behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Earl of</hi> Lenox <hi>his Father in Law had that ſame end, the Nobility repine at the Government of their King, the</hi> King <hi>is in jealouſie of his Nobles, the</hi> Commons <hi>are in way of rebellion. Theſe all have been the effects of my far-mining Policies. And hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they have fallen forth as fortunately, as they were ingeniouſly Plotted. For, what more ingenious and cunning Stratagem could be projected, to decline the rank growth of theſe Uſurpers, then to take them away by handles made of their own Timber? And if there was any wrong in ſuch proceedings, in ſmall matters wrong muſt be done, that juſtice and equity may be performed in great. My fear was (and yet is) that the taking down of the Scaffold of</hi> Mordock <hi>ſhould be the putting up of ours: Crowns ſuffer no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivals, the world knows and he himſelf is conſcious to it, that the right and title of the Crown, by deſcent of blood from</hi> Robert <hi>the ſecond my Father, was in the perſon of</hi> David <hi>my Brother, and is juſtly claimed now by me and our Nephew. As for an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament confirming the right of that other Race, and for oaths of Allegiance, no Parliamentary Authority can take away Juſtice, and the Law of God: neither is an oath to be obſerved when as it tendeth to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:175204:47"/>
Suppreſſion of truth and right; and though for a time ſuch Acts and Oaths have prevailed, our deſigns ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good Succeſs we ſhall have a Parliament appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our right, aboliſhing their pretentions, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them Uſurpers. This one man and a child taken away (if we can give the blow) the Kingdom muſt obey the Lawful Succeſſor; againſt whom what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will revolt, or who dare take armes? and here is more fear than danger. But think there were, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy of eminent dangers is new dangers. It was ſimplicity in him to think by ſmall benefits that old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries are aboliſhed and forgot, and that I ſhould take patiently the title of Earl, when I ſhould have been King my ſelf; by his tyrannizing juſtice, if he be not hated he is not beloved, but become terrible to his people, who now through their poverty and grievances affect a novation, and obey him not out of any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but through neceſſity and fear, and now he alſo feareth that ſome do that to him which he hath deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us reſolve his doubts, our ends are honour and revenge, our wills againſt him all alike and one. The Heavens ſeem to conſpire with us, having brought him to disband his Army, and render himſelf in the wiſhed place of our attempts, and let us rather follow them and fortune, which favours great actions, than ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that preacheth cowardly Patience; Remembring how fair gloſſes of valour for the moſt part have been caſt on the fouleſt deeds, and the mightieſt Families have from them derived their honours, ſhame ſeldom or never following Victory, however it be atchieved and purchaſed. That Soveraignty at the firſt was but a violent uſurpation of the ſtronger over the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. How great Enterprizes muſt begin with danger, but end with rewards, that death ſhould rather be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented than expected, and that it is more honourable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:175204:47"/>
to die, than prolong a life in miſery, wandring in the ſcorn of other mens pride, be reſolute in our Plot, put the enterprize in execution, haſt is the ſpirit of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of danger, the worſt that can befal us is, ſince we cannot ſubſiſt he being alive, that he be taken away whilſt we run a hazard of death, which happeneth to all men alike, with only the difference of Fame or Oblivion with the Poſterity, which ariſeth of an evil action, as well of a good, if the action and attempt be great, but let us not ſpend the time of execution in deliberation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after when they had pondered and digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Deſign, <hi>Graham</hi> and <hi>Stuart</hi> with their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices guided by <hi>Reſolution,</hi> and guarded by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Night, came to the <hi>Blackfryers</hi> of <hi>Perth,</hi> and having the way made open unto them entred the Gallery before the Kings Chamber-door, where they attended ſome of their confederates, who ſhould have ſtoln away the Bar, by which means they might enter the Chamber, but before their coming, Fortune caſteth the occaſion in their hands.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Walter Stratoun</hi> one of the Kings Cupbearers came forth of the Chamber, and finding armed men ruſhing rudely to force their entrie, terrifyed with the boldneſs of the Fact, with a high voice gave the Alarm of Treaſon to his Maſter. While they are working his death, a Maid of honour of the Name of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> got to the door, and eſſaied to ſhut it, but for that the Bar was now away which ſhould have made it faſt, ſhe thruſt her arm in the place where it would have paſſed, but that eaſily broken, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators ruſh into the Chamber, and ſlaying all ſuch of the waiters as made defence (amongſt which was <hi>Patrick Dumbar</hi> Brother to <hi>George</hi> ſometime Earl of <hi>March</hi>) they at laſt ſtroke down the King; whom whilſt the Queen by interpoſing her body ſought to

                  <note place="margin">1436</note>Thus was King <hi>James</hi> the firſt who had ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly deſerved well of the Common-wealth, Murthered the One and twentieth of <hi>February</hi> in the end of the year One thouſand four hundred thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſix, the forty fourth of his age when he had Reigned thirteen years.</p>
               <p>This King was for the proportion and ſhape of his body of a middle ſtature, thick and ſquare, rather ſomewhat mean than tall, not ſuch as is counted for dainty, but for gracefulneſs and Majeſty. His hair was abourn, a colour between white and red. He was of ſo ſtrong and vigorous a conſtitution, that he was able to endure all extraordinary extremities both of travel and want, and ſurpaſſed for agility and nimbleneſs in any exerciſe his Companions. He was of ſo ſharp and pregnant a wit that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein the commendation of wit conſiſted or any ſhadow of the liberal Arts did appear, that he had not applied his mind unto: ſeeming rather born to Letters than inſtructed. He wrote Verſes both <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of which many yet are extant: He exerciſed all Inſtruments of Muſick, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the beſt Profeſſours thereof. He had ſtudied all Philoſophy, but moſt that which concerns Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; in which, what a Maſter he was, the order which he eſtabliſhed in ſuch a confuſion as he found in the State doth witneſs; and many old Laws com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly renewed and amended, others for the publick good eſtabliſhed. He was a great obſerver of Religious Forms: eaſie for acceſs, fair in ſpeech and countenance, in behaviour kind, uſing ſleep and meat to live, not for voluptuouſneſs. He had good command over his Paſſions, his deſires never being

above his reaſon, nor his hopes inferiour to his deſires. Though he was much obliged to the gifts of Nature, yet was he more to his good education and training in <hi>England.</hi> Scarce had he paſſed the ninth year of his age when he was committed to the Sea to ſhun the Treaſons of his Uncle, and was ſurprized at <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough</hi>-head in <hi>Holderneſs. Windſor</hi> Caſtle kept him a Priſoner, but by Commandment of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> he was ſo carefully inſtructed that no Prince could have been better bred in the Schools of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> What his valour was, the wars of <hi>France</hi> bear witneſs: for accompanying the King of <hi>England</hi> there, he layed ſiege to the Town of <hi>Direx,</hi> and with ſuch violence and valour (ſaith the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory) aſſaulted it for the ſpace of ſix weeks, that with main ſtrength he compelled it to be rendred to his hands, and gave it to King <hi>Henry.</hi> That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation which was given him by that ſame King of <hi>England,</hi> being recorded by their writers, proved prophetically true of him. For the King remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him of his benefits received, and promiſing him greater, with free liberty to return to his own Country, if he could cauſe the <hi>Scots</hi> who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to the <hi>Daulphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to return to their native ſoyl and leave him; To this he anſwered, He was a Priſoner, had no poſſeſſion of his Realm that he was neither ſworn to his Subjects, nor they by any Oath of Allegiance bound to him; and though he were bound to them, and they to follow his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment he would foreſee whether it were to him honourable, and to his Realm honeſt, to leave their old Friend of <hi>France</hi> in his extreem neceſſity without aid or comfort. With this anſwer, though the King was not content, when <hi>James</hi> went out of his preſence, he is Recorded to have ſaid, <hi>Happy ſhall they be which ſhall be Subjects to a King endued with ſuch wiſdom of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:175204:49"/>
ſo tender years of age.</hi> His ſeverity in Juſtice was traduced by ſome under terms of cruelty, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the diſorders of his Country, by the fierce nature of the People over whom he ruled, who by often Rebellions did not only exaſperate him to ſome ſeverity, but even conſtrain him to keep them in awe, his rigour was rather an effect of neceſſity than of his natural diſpoſition. No Prince did more reverently entertain Peace at Home amongſt his Subjects, nor more willingly conclude the ſame amongſt Strangers. There is no Prince more cruel than he, who by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and evil meaſured pity, ſuffers Robberies, Rapes, Murders, and all ſorts of oppreſſion and abuſes to overturn his Country, by which a whole State is intereſſed, when the ſtricteſt Juſtice toucheth but ſome particular perſons. By him abuſes were refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, defects repaired, ſedition and diſcord was put from the Nobles, equity and induſtry reſtored to the Country, every man had a certainty of enjoying his own and ſecurity. Into all men was either infuſed a will to do well, or a neceſſity of ſo doing impoſed upon them, vertuous actions being honoured, crimes puniſhed. The mean man did reſpect the great, not fear him; the great man did precede the mean, not contemn him; favour was maſtered by equity, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition by vertue: for the excellent Prince by doing well himſelf had taught his Subjects ſo to do.</p>
               <p>He was one of the worthieſt of all the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> till his time, of the former Kings it might have been ſaid, The Nation made them Kings, but this King made that People a Nation. He left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him one Son and ſix Daughters, King <hi>James</hi> the Second, <hi>Margaret</hi> wife to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, King of <hi>France; Elizabeth</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Bretaigne, Jane</hi> firſt of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> and then Counteſs of <hi>Huntley, Elenora</hi> married to <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,

Mary</hi> wife to the Lord of <hi>Camphire,</hi> and <hi>Annabella;</hi> he was buried in the <hi>Charter-houſe</hi> of <hi>Perth</hi> which he had founded, where the Doublet in which he was ſlain was kept almoſt to our time as a Relict, and with execrations ſeen of the People, every man thinking himſelf intereſted in his wrong.</p>
               <p>The rumour of his Murther blazed abroad, it is incredible what weeping and ſorrow was through all the Country, for even by them to whom his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not pleaſant, he was deplored, and the Act thought execrable. The Nobles of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and motion from all parts of the Kingdom aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and ere they conſulted together (as if they had all one mind) directed troups of armed men through all the quarters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to apprehend the Murtherers and produce them to Juſtice. Such diligence was uſed (grief and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger working in their minds) that within the ſpace of fourty days all the Conſpiratours were taken, and put to ſhameful deaths. The common ſort, as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Clawn</hi> or <hi>Cahown</hi> and others, that were of the Council in the Conſpiracy, having had art or part in the Plot were hanged on Gibbets. The chief Actors, that the Commonwealth might publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction, were made ſpectacles of Juſtice by exquiſite torments, the puniſhment of <hi>Athol</hi> was continued three days: on the firſt he was ſtript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to his ſhirt, and by a Crane fixed in a Cart, often hoiſted aloft, disjoynted, and hanging ſhown to the People, and thus dragged along the great ſtreet of the Town; on the ſecond day he was mounted on a Pillar in the Market-place, he was crowned with a Diadem of burning Iron, with a Plachart bearing, <hi>The King of all Traytors,</hi> thus was his Oracle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; on the third he was laid naked along upon a Scaffold, his Belly was ript up, his heart and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:175204:50"/>
bowels taken out and thrown in a fire flickering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes. Laſtly, his head was cut off and fixed in the moſt eminent place of the Town, his body ſent in quarters to the moſt populous Cities of the Kingdom to remain a Trophie of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>His Nephew <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> was not altogether ſo rigorouſly handled, for that he did but conſent to others wickedneſs, being only hang'd and quarter'd.</p>
               <p>But for that it was notorious, <hi>Robert Graham</hi> had embrewed his hands in the Kings bloud, a Gallows being raiſed in a Cart he had his right hand nailed to it, and as he was dragged along the Street, Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners with burning Pincers, tearing the moſt fleſhy parts off his Carcaſs, being nip'd, torn, and flay'd, his heart and entrails were thrown in a fire, his head exalted, and his Quarters ſent amongſt the Towns, to ſatisfie the wrath and ſorrow of the injured peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; being asked during his torture how he dared put hand in his Prince, he made anſwer, that having Heaven and Hell at his choice, he dared leap out of Heaven and all the contentments thereof, in the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bottoms of Hell, an anſwer worthy ſuch a Traytor.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF THE Reign of James the ſecond, KING of SCOTLAND.</head>
               <p>SCarce were the tears dryed for the loſs of the Father, when the three Eſtates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet, and at <hi>Holy-rood-Houſe,</hi> ſet the Crown upon the head of the Son, then a Child in the ſixth year of his age. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Realm is truſted to Sir <hi>Alexander Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſtoun</hi> of <hi>Calendar;</hi> the cuſtody of the Kings perſon with the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are given to the Chancellor Sir <hi>William Creightoun,</hi> Men for that they had been ever faithful to the Father, without apparent vices, of no capacity to ſucceed, nor enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining aſpiring thoughts for a Diadem, held wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of theſe charges and dignities. Good men may ſecure themſelves from Crimes, but not from Envy and Calumnies; for men great in truſt in publick affairs are ever aſſaulted by the ambition of thoſe who apprehend they are leſs in Employment then they conceive they are in merit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archembald</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> grudging mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the State had beſtowed thoſe honours upon men far inferiour to him, as though by this the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merits of his Anceſtours had been forgotten, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:175204:52"/>
his own ſervices neglected; They being ever accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in times of Peace to be neareſt the Helm of the State, and when any danger of war blazed, ſent abroad to encounter it. In a confuſion of thoſe thoughts being diverſly toſſed, he retireth to his own Caſtles, and after great reſolves proclaimeth, that none of his Vaſſals or Tenants, eſpecially within <hi>Annan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſs-Dale</hi> (parts remote from the more Civil Towns of the Kingdom) ſhould acknowledg th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> preſent Government, or obey any precepts, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or proclamations whereunto the Governours or Chancellours hands were ſet. If any queſtion of Law or contention aroſe amongſt his Friends, Vaſſals, Tenants, He knew none fitter to be their Judge, ſentence all their wrongs, attone and take up their quarrels than himſelf. To diſcover to the world the weakneſs of the two Rulers, and how men never ſo well qualified, ſmall in means, and ſilly of power, were not for great places, he giveth way for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of evil: overſeeing many diſorders, of which he was the ſecret cauſe, eſpecially the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of vagabonding and ravaging Borderers. Men of purpoſe ſent forth to ſpoil and rifle the more qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et parts of the Country, and to cut work to theſe ſtrengthleſs Stateſ-men, as he named them. Thus as overcome with ſloth and pleaſure, he paſſed ſome moneths amidſt Country contentments, expecting what effect time would bring forth of the equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of thoſe two Governours; for to fit minds equal in authority to ſo even a temper that they ſhould not have ſome motions of diſſenting, he thought impoſſible. Neither did his conjecture fail him, the event being the only judge of opinions: for after this the Governour began to jarr with the Chancellour for ingroſſing wholly to himſelf from his Partner the perſon of the King, as an honour which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175204:52"/>
could not altogether be ſeparate from his place, and which would give the greater authority to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; urging, the Chancellour in many other matters had uſurped and taken upon him more than the Parliament granted. The Chancellour was no better affected towards the Governour; what the Governour commanded to be done, he one way or other over-turned. The buildings of the one was by the other demoliſh'd: by common and continual brawlings thus living in turmoil, neither of them was obeyed, the Country uſurped, a licentious liberty, every man doing what he thought beſt for his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advantage and gain. The remote Villages of the Kingdom are left a prey to the lawleſs multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: where their authority is ſcorned, turn places of Robbery; where admitted, places of faction.</p>
               <p>The Queen all this time, after her ordinary cuſtom remained in the Caſtle of <hi>Sterling.</hi> The diviſions, partialities, jealouſies of the Rulers, ſhe taketh in an evil part, knowing uſually they had a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. She had ever found the Governour ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and loyal in his proceedings; againſt his counſel and will, her Son was kept from her by the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour whom the great ones hated for poſſeſſing the King, for drawing to Offices of beſt truſt and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit his own creatures, diſplacing ſuch he ſuſpected to favour his partner in Rule; and the Commons lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not, as managing every thing after his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to their damage and loſs. Tranſported by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers motions ſhe at laſt reſolveth to change the Game of State, and by a womaniſh conceit befool Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Policy. To effectuate her purpoſe ſhe came to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and by many fair and paſſionate ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches obtained of the Chancellour to enter the Caſtle and delight her ſelf ſome days with the company of her Son. Then to countenance her Plot, ſhe giveth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:175204:53"/>
out a Pilgrimage intended by her to the white Kirk in <hi>Buchan:</hi> There will ſhe make offerings for the health of the King, and perform her other vows. The honeſt Stateſ-man, who thought it diſloyalty to diſtruſt a Queen, and a Mother, whom years had made reverend; and impiety to hinder ſuch religious intentions, giveth leave to her ſelf with ſome Servants to remain in the Caſtle, and to tranſport her houſhold ſtuff and other neceſſaries after what manner ſhe pleaſed. In this time ſhe perſuadeth the King, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly ſet and delighting to be obſequious to <hi>Her</hi> his Mother to be handſomly couched in a Trunk, as if he had been ſome fardel of her apparel, and conveyed by one of her truſtieſt Servants upon a Sumpter-horſe to <hi>Leith:</hi> from whence he was put forward by water to <hi>Sterling,</hi> there received by the Governour, and welcomed with great joy and laughter, at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their ſo quaintly deceiving the grave man.</p>
               <p>By this advantage the Reins of Rule were now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Governour: The Queens trick is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, his own proceedings are ſtrengthned and confirmed. Proclamations are made againſt the Chancellour, and he charged to render the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to the King: which he refuſed to do, by a great Power raiſed by the Governour of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and the Queens, and his own followers, he is beſieged and blocked up within the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The Chancellour ready to fall in the danger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering he had to do with too ſtrong a party, implor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the aſſiſtance of the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs:</hi> but the Earl as a matter he had long expected and earneſtly wiſhed might fall forth, refuſeth to aſſiſt any of them, ſaying, <hi>It belonged not to the ancient Nobility to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour theſe Muſhrooms, whoſe ambition with no leſs could he ſatiate than the Government of the whole Realm.</hi> This diſdainful anſwer, procured a meeting
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:175204:53"/>
of the two Rulers, which concluded in the rendring of the Caſtle to the Governour, and a promiſe of true friendſhip between them, that they might not prove a ſport to the envious Nobility. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to ſhew the roundneſs of his intentions and his honeſty, continueth the Chancellour in his office; and reſtoreth him to the keeping of the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> After this agreement the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> left this world at <hi>Reſtalrigge</hi> the year One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred thirty nine, leaving behind him a Son born of the Earl of <hi>Crawfords</hi> daughter, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>William,</hi> who ſucceeded to his Fathers Honours and Ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Malcolm Flamin</hi> of <hi>Cammarnald,</hi> and <hi>Allan Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> upon this young Earls oath of Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> obtain to him from the <hi>French</hi> King the Dutchy of <hi>Tourrain,</hi> which his Father had enjoyed, and given to <hi>Archibald</hi> his Grandfather ſlain at <hi>Vernueil.</hi> This forein dignity with his titles at home made the young man very haughty, and to forget moderation, Diſcretion in youth ſeldom at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending great fortunes. He ſurpaſſed far the King in his followers and train, being accuſtomed to have hundreds of Horſe men attending him; moſt of which were Robbers and men living upon unlawful ſpoils all under his Protection: But however thus he ſeemed to ſet forth his greatneſs, this ſeemed much to bewray a diſtruſt, and that he rather travelled amongſt a people which hated him, than amongſt his friends and men lovingly diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James Stuart</hi> Son to the Lord of <hi>Lorne</hi> about this time marryed the Queen Dowager, not ſo much out of love of her Perſon as Dowry, as of Ambition, by her means intending to reach the Government of the State, and get into his cuſtody the Perſon of the King. And that it might rather ſeem the work of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:175204:54"/>
others out of conveniency, than any appetite of his own, he ſo inſinuated himſelf with the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> that the Earl eſſayed to lay the firſt ground-work of his aims. The Governour who never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his own Spies near the Queen, at the firſt inkling of this novation committed both him and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>William</hi> into the Caſtle of <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The Queen whether ſhe followed her Husband, or was reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, uncertain, ſtaied with them, and now began to repent her of the former courteſies done to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; wiſhing her Son had yet remained in the cuſtody of the Chancellour, who, not ſo diſpleaſed at their impriſonment as he appeared in outward-ſhow (delighting in the errours of his Partner) by <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> trafficked and wrought their liberty. Thus inſinuating himſelf in the Queens favour, he irritated her againſt the Governour: whom yet outwardly he entertained with ceremonies of Friendſhip, approving his Sagacity in preventing a ſtorm in the State before it brake forth: here the Governour found how that ſame Key which can open a Treaſure can ſhut it up: for after this the Queen prepared her Son for a change. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour carefully miniſtring Juſtice at <hi>Perth,</hi> the Chancellour one morning coming to the Park of <hi>Sterling</hi> where the King was hunting, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of his Mother more early raiſed for this ſport, ſhe bewailed the preſent eſtate of his Court, that he was thralled to the covetouſneſs and pleaſure of others, living under the power of a man greedy of Rule: that a King of <hi>France</hi> is declared to be of full years and Major the fourteenth of his age, that a Prince ſhould transfer his affection eſpecially in tender years; that by an eſcape he might enjoy a princely freedom, better know himſelf, and make his Rulers reliſh his Authority; that three hours was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:175204:54"/>
ſometimes of more importance than three days, and one hour of more than all the three; that he ſhould take hold of the preſent occaſion offered him. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſuch informations he is no ſooner accoſted by the Chancellour, when approving his motions he poſted towards <hi>Edenburgh</hi> with him: received all the way as he went with many companies of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours friends and attendants. The Governour finding the face of the Court altered, by a King young in years and judgment, poſſeſſed by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſſimulating his intereſt, in a patient and calm manner cometh to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> there after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and mediation of friends in Saint <hi>Giles</hi>'s Church, he meeteth the Chancellour, and by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Murray's</hi> and <hi>Aberdeen's</hi> diligence an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is between them concluded, which was, That the King ſhould remain in the cuſtody of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and the Governour ſhould ſtill enjoy his charge. Amongſt theſe diviſions of the Rulers the Queen all this time handſomly kept ſome authority, affecting and entertaining ſometimes the one of them ſometimes the other, as by turns they governed the King and State.</p>
               <p>The many and great diſorders in the Country in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited a Parliament: the authority of Magiſtrates was deſpiſed, no juſtice was adminiſtred in many places, few could keep their Goods, or be aſſured of their Lives, but by taking themſelves to the ſervitude of one Faction or other. Troubles aroſe in the Weſt by the ſlaughter of Sir <hi>Allan Stuart</hi> Lord <hi>Darnley,</hi> killed by Sir <hi>Thomas Boyd;</hi> and by the Revenge of his Death taken by <hi>Alexander Stewart</hi> of <hi>Bolmet</hi> his Brother upon the <hi>Boyd;</hi> the Highland Iſlanders invade the Territories adjacent to them, ſpoyl and burn the <hi>Lennox,</hi> where <hi>John Calhowen</hi> of <hi>Luſs</hi> is maſſacred. Theſe cruelties and inſolencies againſt all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:175204:55"/>
juſtice and authority being avouched ſuch to beware, held fit to be remedied and courſes laid down to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them: but <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> permitting wickedneſs, and winking at miſchief, often approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for lawful and good policy, whilſt he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reformed them himſelf by his power, nor ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Rulers to proceed againſt them by their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; purchaſed to himſelf the name and reputation of a lawleſs and ſtrong oppreſſor. The three Eſtates aſſembled, complaints being given up againſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſours, moſt againſt him and his followers, as the ſource from which the miſeries of the Country ſprang, he appeareth not, nor any to anſwer for him.</p>
               <p>The Parliament determinateth to proceed by way of Rigour againſt him; but to this the two Rulers op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, perſuading them that fair ſpeeches and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was a ſafer and eaſier way to draw unto them a young Man, mighty in riches and power, arrogant by his many Followers and Vaſſals, than to give out a Sentence againſt him before he were heard, and by threatnings ſtir his turbulent and ambitious thoughts, which inſtead of making him calm, might turn his neutrality in a perfect Rebellion: and his inſolency, in madneſs and deſpair. Neither as the preſent eſtate of the Country ſtood, could he without civil blood be commanded and brought in, which by moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be effectuate; that verity enjoyed not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that priviledge to be ſpoken in every place and time; it was good to keep up in ſilence matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, the ſpeaking of which might produce any dangerous effec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Upon this, Letters in their name are ſent unto him, remembring him of the ſplendor and glory of his Anceſtors, the place and dignity he poſſeſſed by them in Parliament: that without his preſence they neither would or could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in great matters. If he apprehended any cauſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:175204:55"/>
of let or ſtay by the offences and diſorders commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Attendants and followers, they would free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remit them, as accidents following the injury of the times, and his yet tender years, his greateſt fault being his giving way out of raſhneſs and negligence to the faults of others. That of himſelf they had conceived ſuch ſingular hopes of great towardneſs and all venues, if he would come and take a part with them, giving in his complaints and grievances, he ſhould not only have full ſatisfaction, but be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with what place or charge in the Government he liked beſt; by honouring them with his Preſence he ſhould oblige not only his Country infinitely but particularly every one of them to ſtand for him to the utmoſt of their powers and wiſhes.</p>
               <p>This Letter wrought powerfully upon the Mind of the Earl, by nature and years deſirous of glory and preferment, and believing eaſily that which was plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to his hopes. His friends, who now began to promiſe to themſelves new Heavens, think upon great matters, and forecaſt to themſelves by the change of their Lords Fortune, a change of Offices in the State, perſuade him likewiſe to come to the Parliament; and they divulged the certainty of his Progreſs. The Chancellour when he underſtood he was upon his way rode forth of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to meet him, and by many obſequious complements and friendly blandiſhments allured and drew him to his Caſtle of <hi>Creighton</hi> which was in his way: where ſome days he reſted and was honourably entertained.</p>
               <p>Among many healthful admonitions by way of counſel, he told him, that the greatneſs of a Subject conſiſted in due obedience to his Prince, whom he ſhould acknowledge to be his Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>That by obedience he would vindicate the Name and Families of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> not only from blame

of Treaſon, but from all ſuſpition of Novations; that he would endeavour to execute juſtice more ſtrictly than he had done in times paſt, not protect Oppreſſors againſt Laws and Equity, but ſuppreſs all inſolencies of Thieves and Robbers, becauſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties and wrongs never ſtood ſecure before either God or man. That the eſtates of ancient Houſes were often maintained more by reputation of things done, than any other foundation, which a little diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to a Prince might ſhake, if not altogether ruine. That it was fatal to all Princes in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-age, and the beginnings of their Reigns, to have troubles and ſeditions, and be tormented by ſome of their Subjects who ſtudied novelties; but when theſe Princes came to perfect years, they knew well to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe thoſe who troubled the Government in their youth. That he would hereafter rather content himſelf with mediocrity, than expoſe himſelf as a mark to envy. That he would make a proof of his power, not in exceſs and riot or pride of his ancient honours, but in bounty and religious charity toward his Country-men.</p>
               <p>That he wiſhed as his Houſe had long continued, it might by following what he had ſpoken unto him ever flouriſh. The Earl of a good inclination, if flatterers and wicked company had been removed, took in good part his advertiſements and counſel, thinking he ſpake as he thought, and (perhaps) ſo he did, for he had not yet put on his double Viſage, and promiſed to repair what offences by youth, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, raſhneſs or other indiſcretion had eſcaped him: thus with his Brother <hi>David,</hi> the Chancellour accompanied him to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had not long there ſtayed, when the frequent meetings, many ſecret conferences of the Governour and Chancellour at their ſeveral houſes, which often
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:175204:56"/>
held the greateſt part of the night, who were not wont to be ſo kind to others, bred a great jealouſie and ſuſpicion in ſome of the Earls friends, that ſome lurking miſchief was a plotting to entrap him. That ſmall truſt ſhould be had in a reconciled enemy, and his many courteſies, and too exceeding favours were to be ſuſpected. Hereupon ſome freely counſel the Earl to return home, and to leave off private meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them. Others intreat him not to enter the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> at all, or if he ſhould, to diſmiſs his brother <hi>David,</hi> to keep themſelves ſcattered that that they might not be incloſed in one Net, as upon his Death-bed their Father had inſtructed and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them. For if any violent courſe were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, men would not dare to put in act againſt one of them which they would againſt both. <hi>David</hi> preſaging ſome ſtrange accident to follow this ſudden kindneſs of the Rulers was meditating an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. The Earl took this counſel in an evil part, ſaying, <hi>Great Families never wanted turbulent friends, to whom common confuſions ſerved ordinarily for ſteps to enlarge their States, when Peace ſendeth the moſt part of them home to live private men.</hi> And they cared not what blame were laid upon their Chiefs, ſo it ſtood with their own commodity; that the pretence of his departure would be worſe than the departure it ſelf, and that he would be obnoxious to worſe ſurmiſes, and more miſerable miſtakings go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, than if he had never appeared. That he preferred the approved truſt of the Chancellour (whoſe Gueſt he had been) to all the objections of dangers they could imagine; which ſuſpicions he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted them to ſuppreſs; for to ſuſpect cauſleſly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of imagining wrong, returned a real injury, and being known, would be a means to breed new jars, and break their begun Friendſhip. Thus blind-folded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:175204:57"/>
by Deſtinie, and accompanied with ſome of his deareſt friends, amongſt whom was Sir <hi>Malcolm Flaming</hi> of <hi>Cammernald;</hi> in ſolemn pomp with his Brother he entred <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Caſtle the Twenty fourth of <hi>November:</hi> the remainder who were thruſt back with ſad countenances and diſtruſting hearts, ſcattered themſelves in the Town.</p>
               <p>The Governour, that the envy might be divided and ſhared, and all ſeem to be done by an univerſal conſent, with a ceremonious welcom, and ſuch as hate and emulation could ſuffer to be tempered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, did meet him and guide him to the King: at whoſe Table he was ſet to dine, which favours turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of the young Earl ſo ſoft and relenting, that he wiſhed he had ſooner come to Court, and challeng'd himſelf of his miſtruſtful thoughts; but more his ſuſpicious friends, whoſe preſence he could have deſired to be witneſs againſt themſelves. The counſel given him at <hi>Creighton</hi> Caſtle, by obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, he reſolveth to thank: the Kings benign aſpect and courteſies of the Rulers had advanced him to the higheſt degree of honour.</p>
               <p>Amidſt of theſe entertainments (behold the inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Fortune!) near the end of the Banquet the head of a Bull (a ſign of preſent Death in theſe times) is ſet down before him: At which ſudden Spectacle he leapt from the Table in horror and all agaſt; but this doth little avail him, he hath no power, for he is ceaſed upon by armed Men, who ruſhing out of a cruel tyring Houſe, led him to the utter Court of the Caſtle, not regarding the plaints, cryes, tears of the young King, who pitifully mourned to ſee him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacled with cords: There with his Brother <hi>David,</hi> Sir <hi>Malcolm Flaming</hi> his conſtant friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner of all his Fortunes, he had his head and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious thoughts cut off. With this great blow of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:175204:57"/>
State the Parliament brake up, leaving grief, terrour, aſtoniſhment in the hearts of all the people, who ever hated the Actors of this Tragedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his Brother taken away, the Baron of <hi>Abercorn</hi> their Uncle ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Earldom, by reaſon of his ſtature and corpulency named <hi>James</hi> the Groſs: a man free of any vice or Heroical Vertue, whoſe years were not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny after his fortune to be Earl. He was Father to ſeven Sons, the eldeſt of which by a Diſpenſation from the <hi>Pope</hi> he married to <hi>Beatrice,</hi> the only Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his Brothers Son <hi>William,</hi> named <hi>The fair Maid of Galloway,</hi> not ſo much in reſpect of her Beauty, as her Fortunes; the Lands not tailed in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway, Annandale, Balveny</hi> and <hi>Ormond,</hi> falling from the Heirs male to be her Portion. This Marriage was much blamed and cryed out upon by the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Sir <hi>John Dowglaſs</hi> of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and other Gentlemen of that Name, not as they gave out for the propinquity of blood, being between Couſin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but that ſo fair and eaſie a purchaſe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of their arms. They had always followed the King, and procured prohibitions of the Marriage; but theſe with ſpur-haſte advanced the celebration of it, and upon a <hi>Friday,</hi> which the common People prognoſticate to be ominous, and to have ſome ſad event.</p>
               <p>This Earl, ambitious, factious, popular, ſubtile, vindicative, prompt in the execution of his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, liberal and far from the dor-muſe humour of his Father, began to think neither himſelf nor his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in ſafety, if the deaths of his Brothers and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins, wrought by the two Rulers remained unreveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and therefore ſince openly without troubling the common peace of the Country he could not, by ſecret and umbragious ways he laboureth to bring it to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:175204:58"/>
paſs: procuring a far off a diſobedience to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and contempt of their Authority, by men in a great diſtance from him in place, blood, friendſhip and familiarity; who after any faſhion grudged, repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, complained of the preſent form of Government, or aggravated imaginary wrongs, are ſupported and protected by him, his houſes turned places of Refuge to diſtreſſed Male-contents. One <hi>John Gormack</hi> of <hi>Athol</hi> (not without ſuſpicion that he wrought by the motion and order of the Earl, and underſtood his Cabal) eſſayed with a great number of Out-laws to hinder the execution of a Malefactor, and take him by main force from the Sheriff of <hi>Perth, William Ruthen:</hi> but he periſhed in the enterprize. <hi>Patrick Gilbreath</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbartoun,</hi> for priority of command, killeth <hi>Robert Simple,</hi> and to ſave his perſon, or juſtifie his homicide, flyeth to the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> by whom he is protected, notwithſtanding the many informations given in againſt him at Court, and his citation to anſwer to Juſtice.</p>
               <p>The King whoſe non-age was now near expired, began to reliſh the ſweetneſs of Government in his own perſon, and became tyr'd of the long and awful tutelage of his jarring Rulers; and the flower of his Youth ſeeming fram'd for great affairs, promiſed the fruit of a wiſe and happy Reign; finding it difficult to put men near daily unto him, long experienced and greedy of Rule, from high places, except by the entertaining a ſtronger and more powerful faction: He ſetteth his thoughts upon the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs;</hi> ſmall favours to him would be a great umbrage to the ambition of his Tutors, bring them within the compaſs of anſwering to what might be objected to them concerning their ſervice in the State; he would not ſue to the Earl, but as occaſion ſerved he gave many ſigns and open ſpeeches, that he had not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:175204:58"/>
withdrawn his love and favour from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Houſe of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> their paſſed faults being by them acknowledged and recompenced with fidelity and obedience in times coming. The Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> whoſe towardneſs and liberality had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him many friends at Court, upon aſſured ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of his Princes good-will towards him, cometh to <hi>Sterling,</hi> and is no ſooner preſented upon his knees before the King in the Church, when with all demonſtrations of benevolence he is received in grace, pardoned, and not many days after admitted to be of the Privy Council. The King imparting to him his greateſt affairs, ſheweth he will follow them by his advice and counſel, honoureth him with the plauſible name of Couſin, and entertaineth ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him that all others give him the place.</p>
               <p>The promotion and credit which the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> in a ſhort time acquired about the King, his faction daily encreaſing, moved the two Rulers (by their moderation ſeeking to avoid diſgrace) to leave the Court. After which they were both removed from their offices, and their places and authority in Council with their whole friends and followers. They are upbraided with diſorders, both in their private actions and the manner of their Government, and at laſt are ſummoned to anſwer before the King to ſuch things as they ſhould be legally accuſed of; the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs every where whiſpered amongſt the people, warned and certified them, if they ſhould appear and preſent themſelves, of ſome ſad and Tragick Act. Whereupon with proteſtations of their Innocency declining the time, appealing to the King in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, and when he ſhould be of full years, from theſe Judges their mortal enemies than abuſing abſolute Power, they ſuſpend their appearing, declaring with all their readineſs in every thing to obey the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:175204:59"/>This availeth them nothing, for at a Parliament holden in <hi>Sterlin,</hi> Articles being forged and urged againſt them, eſpecially of Peculate, as ſale of Crown-Lands, waſte of the Kings Treaſure, the laying of their hands upon the Kings Jewels, tranſporting Lands to themſelves and their friends, diſtributing Offices and places of the Crown and State (which ſhould have been by the Authority of the Council) as Hunters divide a Prey between themſelves. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with Riots, and taking the force and vigour from the Laws of the Kingdom; thus as betraying the adminiſtration of the Realm into the hands of worthleſs and corrupted men, they are denounced Rebels, their perſons and Eſtates proſcrib'd. Charge is given to Sir <hi>John Foſter</hi> of <hi>Corſtorphane</hi> and others the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> adherents, to bring all their moveables to the uſe of the Exchequer, demoliſh their Houſes, invade their Friends with fire and ſword, and all that ſided them. Thus the uncertain viciſſitude of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane accidents overturns often them who ſeem to be raiſed to the higheſt degree of honour. The Caſtle of <hi>Barentoren</hi> is beſieged, taken, thrown down, with other houſes upon the Governours and Chancellours Lands, their Farms and ſmall Villages are plundered and ranſacked. In revenge of which the Rulers waſte the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> Territories, the Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Straw-brock, Abercorn, Blackneſs</hi> are burnt, with <hi>Corſtorphane.</hi> The ravage begun, continueth with daily loſs to both parties, and the overthrow of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>The Earl wondreth (now having the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) to find his enemies ſo ſtrong, and hold ſo long out againſt him, he ſuſpecteth they have ſecret ſupport by ſome not well affected towards him. The moſt powerful and eminent of which he gueſſeth to be <hi>James Kennedy</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:175204:59"/>
Couſin german to the King. He knew him jealous for his ſudden favours at Court, and that he had whiſpered amongſt his friends, that he feared the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Earls unlimited heart was now exalted to ſuch exorbitancy of height, that becoming top-heavy it would fall by its own weight, and turn up the Root.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> will have this Prelate leſs powerful to aſſiſt the Rulers, or do harm unto him, To this effect he inſtigateth the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> his Allie, and <hi>Alexander Ogleby</hi> of <hi>Innerwharely,</hi> to invade the Biſhops Lands, and rifle his Vaſſals in <hi>Fife,</hi> without order or declaration of wrongs done by him. The Biſhop after the burning and ſpoyling of ſundry of his Farms, being weak by power to reſiſt their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and repair his loſſes, took him to his Spiritual Arms, and excommunicated the Earl of <hi>Crawford.</hi> Though he made ſmall account of this verbal Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet did not this injuſtice long eſcape the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of God, who raiſeth up ordinarily one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor to execute his juſtice againſt another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander Lyndeſay,</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> pretended a title to the Baylerie of <hi>Arbroth,</hi> out of which he was kept by <hi>Alexander Ogleby,</hi> whoſe title was equal to his, if not better. This enmity kindled to ſuch a flame, that upon either ſide they aſſemble their friends in Arms: The <hi>Ogleby</hi> calleth the Lord <hi>Huntley,</hi> the <hi>Lindeſay</hi> the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> to aſſiſt their Rights: frequent meetings having been to calm mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and reconcile them, and nothing agreed upon nor concluded, they reſolve at laſt to decide the cauſe by their Swords. The Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Dundee,</hi> advertiſed of the preſent danger of his friends, poſted in all haſte to <hi>Arbroth,</hi> and cometh at the very chock of the skirmiſh, and when hey were to enter the Fight. Here intending by his

wiſdom to take up the quarrel, and preſuming upon the reſpect due to his place and perſon, he raſhly ruſheth forwards before his Companies to demand a party of <hi>Alexander Ogleby</hi> with his Son: But ere he could be known or was heard, he is encountred by a common Souldier, who thruſt him in the mouth with a Spear, and proſtrate him dead upon the ground. This ſudden accident joyned the Parties, who fought with great courage and reſolution: The Victory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much blood inclined to the Maſter of <hi>Crawford. Alexander Ogleby</hi> ſore wounded, was taken and brought to the Caſtle of <hi>Finelvin</hi> where he died; the Lord <hi>Huntley</hi> eſcaped by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe. <hi>John Forbeſs</hi> of <hi>Pitſligow, Alexander Barkley</hi> of <hi>Garteley, Robert Maxwell</hi> of <hi>Tillen, William Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doun</hi> of <hi>Borrowfield,</hi> Sir <hi>John Oliphant</hi> of <hi>Aberda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guy</hi> with others fell on the <hi>Oglebies</hi> ſide; they fought the Twenty fourth of <hi>January</hi> One thouſand four hundred fourty five.<note place="margin">1445</note>

               <p>Now by attending opportunities to encreaſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick diſorders, turn the times dangerous and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and confound the State; the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> kept himſelf in the abſolute Government; by um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bragious ways he nouriſhed diſcontentments in all parts of the Country, amongſt the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Commons of the Realm. <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> put to death <hi>John Lynton of Dundee, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Boyd</hi> of <hi>Duchal,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Lyle</hi> ſlew <hi>James Stuart</hi> of <hi>Auchenmintee; Patrick Hepburn</hi> of <hi>Hails,</hi> ſurpriſed the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar; Archembald Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> as if he would but change places with him, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Caſtle of <hi>Hails,</hi> where he was beſieged by the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> and with conditions of ſafety rendred it.

Nine months the Aſſailers lie about it: but it proveth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, and without loſs of many Subjects can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken, about the end of which time, mens cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages waxing colder, conditions are offered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; which were, that the Chancellor ſhould be reſtored to grace, place, and whatſoever had been withheld from him by his enemies at Court, an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition and abrogation of all former diſcontentments ſhould be granted, the beſieged ſhould paſs out bag and baggage free.

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:175204:62"/>This Truce was not long kept by any of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but, as it had been drawn and plaiſtered up for the faſhion, they conſpire equally to break it. New incurſions are made, ſlight skirmiſhes began to wound either ſide and baniſh Peace, juſt arms were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at laſt to be oppoſed to injurious oppreſſions. The <hi>Scots</hi> having made deſolate ſome parts of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> an Army under the leading of the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> is raiſed, commanded by <hi>Magnus</hi> Red-beard, whom the <hi>Scots</hi> by reaſon of the length of his beard named <hi>Magnus</hi> with a red Main.

After his fall many turning their backs, the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> himſelf with great danger eſcaped; more in the chaſe were loſt than in the Battel; ſuch who eſſayed to paſs the River, by the confuſion and the weight of their Arms were plunged in the water; others who could not find the Fords, being taken,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:175204:63"/>
and brought to the Caſtle of <hi>Lochmaben;</hi> amongſt which were Sir <hi>John Pennington,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Piercy,</hi> who by ſaving his Father en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged himſelf.

               <p>This Victory obtained chiefly by the valour of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> advanced highly their credit with the young King, and the Court ſounded with nothing more than their praiſes. But great fortunes are as hard to bear as to acquire, and ordinarily proſperity carryeth us into inſolencies, without pondring the conſequence of our actions. <hi>William Colvill</hi> Knight, upon a private quarrel having ſlain <hi>James Auchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck</hi> a follower of the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> the Earl avenged his death, not only with the ſlaughter of <hi>William,</hi> but with the throwing down of his Houſe, and ſpoil of all his Lands: which turned cold the affections of many about the Court towards him, and made him terrible to all of a contrary Faction to his. After, whether tyred with his working thoughts, or to ſhun more hatred and envy, or to try what time would produce, amidſt the inward grudges and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of Court, or that he held his own Country too narrow Liſts for his glory, he leaveth the Kingdom: ſubſtituting one of his Brothers Procurator for his affairs, and in his abſence to govern his eſtate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied

with his Brother Mr. <hi>James</hi> (a Man learned, and brought up in Sorbon Divinity, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectant of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Dunkel, James Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of <hi>Cadyow,</hi> the Lords <hi>Grahame, Seatoun, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, Saltoun,</hi> and many Gentlemen, he arriveth in <hi>Flanders,</hi> cometh to <hi>France,</hi> paſſeth the <hi>Alps,</hi> and it being the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> ſtayeth at <hi>Rome:</hi> where he was honourably received and welcomed. <hi>Envy never leaveth great Actors;</hi> he had not been long abſent from his Prince, when many are ſuborned to give up complaints againſt the oppreſſions, riots, wrongs of his Kindred, Servants and Vaſſals. The faults of his Governing the King are pryed into, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry overſight and eſcape aggravated to the height. The <hi>King</hi> at firſt was loth to lend an ear to miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and calumnies of a man lately ſo well deſerving and dearly of him beloved: but overcome by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and urged by the numbers of Complainers, he gave way that his Brother and Procurators ſhould make anſwer for wrongs ſuffered by the complainers: after many citations his Brother not appearing is at laſt by force preſented to the Council: when he could not anſwer to ſuch faults as were laid againſt the Earls Vaſſals and followers, nor acquit them of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent oppreſſions, he was only enjoyned to reſtore to the Complainers their loſs, and reſtore all damages. Upon fair promiſes of Reſtitution the King bringeth him off the danger, and obtaineth him liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home.</p>
               <p>There, after long adviſement with his other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſome haughty Vaſſals, they declare, old Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and wrongs being joyned to new, and reſent with which they were charged, the reſtitution was impoſſible, and like ſpilt water which could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Not ſatisfied with this anſwer, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil cited the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> upon ſome days to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:175204:64"/>
before them, and all his Vaſſals and followers with his Brothers to anſwer according to Law, to ſuch Articles as ſhould be given in againſt them. The Earl was far off, and they conſidered it conſiſted not with their weal to hazard their perſons to the arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Judges, many of which had been obnoxious to their affronts. Thus for not appearing they are denounced Rebels, and Warrants granted to invade and ſpoyl their Lands, as publick enemies to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the preſent Government. This Decree is followed by open force; and to facilitate the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and to take up the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> Rents, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> cometh to <hi>Galloway, Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs-dale, Liddeſ-dale:</hi> But he found, Authority not ſeconded with power againſt luſty Rebels, to produce weak effects; for he returned, diſobeyed, contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and near ſpoiled and rifled by the Earls Tenants and Vaſſals.</p>
               <p>The King to vindicate his Authority, ſince he could not prevail by reaſon, with competent Forces in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon entreth the ſame Territories, taketh all the ſtrong Fortreſſes and Caſtles where he came, demoliſheth the Caſtle of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> placeth a Garriſon in <hi>Loch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabane,</hi> giveth the cuſtody of ſuch places he ſpared with the whole Goods and Moveables appertaining to them, to the Complainers and men intereſted in wrongs or blood by the Rebels. The noiſe of this unexpected backblow being heard at <hi>Rome,</hi> perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a little the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs:</hi> Many of his train leave him, that where lately he repreſented a Prince, he ſeemed now ſcarce a private Gentleman; he was aſſured he lived under a Soveraign who mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre all detractions, would hear his own defences. Upon which hopes he reſolveth to return, taketh him to his Journey, and for his greater haſte and ſafe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, he obtaineth a Paſs through <hi>England,</hi> come to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:175204:64"/>
the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his Brother <hi>James</hi> is directed to the Court, to underſtand the Kings mind towards him, and if there were any poſſibility in this ebb of favours to have acceſs to him.</p>
               <p>The King ingeniouſly promiſeth to accept him, and performed it, for all that hapned by the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor of his Friends in his abſence, requeſting that he would but live peaceably according to the order of the State, without hating that which his Prince loved, or improving that which he approved and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized; and that as himſelf and his Brothers were ever the moſt able and readieſt to repeal the wrongs of Strangers, ſo they would endeavour to entertain unity and concord in the Country it ſelf, and purge their Lands of Thieves and Robbers; if miſchievous and wicked men were not puniſhed, there would be no ſurety nor ſafety for the good and vertuous. Paſt wrongs are pardoned, the Garriſons removed from his Caſtles, and they are rendred unto him. Then to put him in aſſurance of encreaſing favours, he is made Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, a place great and requiring great action, being only to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon a Man active, great in power and friends.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> again afloat in the ſtream of his Soveraigns favours, might have continued, if his miſeries had not been decreed from above: ſoon after he falls in a new diſgrace; whether upon a promiſe of return, or that he was ſent for, or that he would officiouſly give thanks for receiving cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies when he was in his way homewards, he paſſeth privately to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and without his Maſters knowledge or leave hath many days ſerious conference with the Nobility of that Kingdom, then many ways diſtreſſed by the Rebellion of <hi>Kent,</hi> and the Factions of the great Men. The pretended
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:175204:65"/>
cauſe of his journey was given out to be the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own and his Vaſſals loſſes, ſuſtained by the inrodes of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the time of his travels abroad, and the redreſſing of other diſorders on the <hi>Weſt</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but his Enemies ſuggeſted he intended to enter a League with ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Maſter, and trouble of his Country, by changing the Form of Government, or the Officers of State. King <hi>James</hi> took his meeting with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in an evil part; but after great interceſſion and many requeſts of the Queen and Noblemen after he had ſubmitted himſelf to his clemency, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his Errors, received him. In this mean time he is diſcharged of all publick employments; his Offices of State are divided between the Earl of <hi>Orkney</hi> and the Lord <hi>Creightoun</hi> his reconciled Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Removed from publick employments he giveth himſelf to ſtudy private revenge, and the whole ſecret Council turn diſtaſteful unto him: eſpecially <hi>Orkney</hi> and <hi>Creightoun,</hi> men perfectly abhorring his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and who greatly feared his diſmeaſured greatneſs.</p>
               <p>Their ſuſpected affronts and alledged wrongs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him were increaſed daily by tales of Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. It was told the Earl, that the Lord <hi>Creigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi> in conference with the King, had ſaid, it were expedient for the peace of the Country, That the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> with all his friends and followers were rooted out, and their memory aboliſhed; but if that were left undone, neither ſhould the King rule in due Majeſty, nor the Subjects ever give him that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they ought. That wiſe Princes ſuffered houſes to grow as men do Spider-webs, not taking heed of them ſo long as they were ſmall, but when offenſively encreaſed, they ſwept them wholly away. Irritated by theſe and many ſuch like ſpeeches, after
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:175204:65"/>
much contempt of the Chancellour, on dawning, as he was early coming from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to his Caſtle of <hi>Creighton,</hi> the Earl who wanted not his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence amongſt his followers (Hatred being an evil Counſellour) laid an ambuſh for him on the high way. But the clearneſs of the morning diſcovering it, by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe he eſcapeth; ſome of his company being wounded, and one of the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſlain in the purſuit. Two days after, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to repair his credit, accompanied with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his friends and followers, coming in great haſte to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> had unawares ſurprized the Earl of <hi>Dowglas,</hi> then attended but with a ſmall number of his friends, if he had not ſpeedily ſhifted himſelf from the danger. This contention now burſting forth into open Hoſtility, divided into Factions the whole Kingdom; The Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his by the long continued grandeur of his Houſe, the Chancellor ſtanding by his Princes favour, and a long practice of the affairs and courſe of the World; The Earl fearing the Authority of the King might ſway the Ballance and make the party unequal, if he ſhould be brought to call to remembrance paſſed actions and attempts of his Predeceſſors, findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more expedient to curb his enemies, and ſtrengthen his proceedings, than to renew his old Confederation, and combine with him many others. Hereupon the Earls of <hi>Crawford, Roſs, Murray, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the Lord <hi>Balvenny,</hi> Knight of <hi>Cadyow,</hi> many Barons, Gentlemen with their Allies, Vaſſals, Servants to a great number, ſubſcribed and ſwore ſolemnly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to deſert one another during life; That injuries done to any one of them, ſhould be done to them all, and be a common quarrel; neither ſhould they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to their beſt abilities to revenge them: That they ſhould concur indifferently againſt whatſoever Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:175204:66"/>
within or without the Realm, and ſpend their Lives, Lands, Goods, Fortunes in defence of their Debates and Differences whatſoever. This confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Covenant again renewed, turned the Earl imperious in his deportments, preſumptuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all limits, and his followers and adherents inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to their neighbours: The Lands of ſuch who were not of their party, or refuſed to think all their thoughts and ſecond them in their enterprizes, were plundered; and goodneſs was a cauſe to make men ſuffer moſt pillage and ranſacking of their Goods, and other miſerable calamities. At this time the Thieves and Robbers of <hi>Liddeſ-dale</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandale</hi> break into the Lands of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Herreſs,</hi> a Noble Man, who had continued conſtantly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the King, and drive with them a great booty of Cattle: Complaints being given to the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> of the Depredations of his men, and finding no redreſs, the Lord <hi>Herreſs</hi> eſſayeth to drive the like prey in recompence of the damage; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal in power, his fortune was to be taken by the Thieves, and brought as a Priſoner to the Earl, who layed him faſt in Irons; and notwithſtanding of the Kings Letters (full of Intreaties and Threatnings) without any formality of Law, cauſed, Hang him as a Felon: The like miſchief was practiſed in other places. After this contempt of Soveraignty, it was univerſally blazed, that the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his new Covenant, the power of his Kinſmen and Allies, the entertaining of ſuch who were diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and diſcountenanced at Court, the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the men of Arms in <hi>Scotland</hi> (ever governed by ſome of his Name) his riches, the honour of his Anceſtors, had reſolved to diſſemble no longer, but openly to play his game, eſſay one day if he could ſet the Crown upon his own head, being then able
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:175204:66"/>
to raiſe an Army of Forty thouſand warlike perſons, men ready to go with him, whither, or againſt whom they cared not, attending only the occaſion and his Commandment.</p>
               <p>The King who before but diſdained the pride, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this League became jealous of the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> (a League giving a Law to a King breaking all bonds of Soveraignty, and inviting a people to look for a new Maſter) and though his modeſty and patience ſerved only to turn the Earl more inſolent, and his boldneſs more active, yet in a foul game he bare a fair countenance; knowing the laſt thing which a Soveraign Prince ſhould do, is to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Male-content and offended with any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; for inſtead of chaſtiſing him, he would give him fairer means and greater power to do him harm: He would not ſhew a token of any prejudicial thought to the Earls proceedings, till he had firſt heard himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus very calmly he deſired him to come and ſpeak with him at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> whiles he (conſcious of his own miſdemeanor) except upon a publick aſſurance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great Seal for his ſafe coming and return, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do: A ſafe conduct obtained,<note place="margin">1452</note> about the Shrew-tide, in the year One thouſand four hundred fifty two he came to the Court then remaining at <hi>Sterlin</hi> Caſtle, accompanied with many of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, and a powerful Retinue: The King with a gracious countenance, and all apparent reſpect recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, endeavouring rather by kindneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, than by rigor to reclaim him to his former obedience. The day near ſpent, the Gates of the Caſtle ſhut, all removed, except ſome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and the Guards; the King taking the Earl friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apart, remembred him of favors received, wrongs forgotten, the duties, as a Subject, he owed to his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:175204:67"/>
Prince, his capitulation before he would come and ſpeak with him; he taxed him with the exorbitant abuſes and outrages of his followers: then he told him what Informations he had of a Covenant of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual defence and adherence betwixt him and ſome of his Nobles and Gentlemen, which he would ſcarce believe: He prayed him to conſider the murmuring, or rather begun ſedition of his people, his long pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in tolerating his proceedings, his misbelief of evil reports towards him, until he had heard what he had to ſay for himſelf and his innocency.</p>
               <p>The Earl anſwered the Kings towardneſs in equal terms, truſting much to his confederation; for his favours he ſhould ſtrive with all obſequiouſneſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them; That as he had the honour to command others who obeyed him, he knew very well how to be commanded, and obey his Prince, and in what diſobedience conſiſted; that as none of his Subjects enjoyed more Lands and Honours than himſelf, there ſhould not one be found who more willingly would engage all his fortunes and perſon for the Honour of his Prince: That they who layed ſnares for his life, being ſo near his Majeſty, for the ſurety of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he could not come to Court, except upon a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick aſſurance, and well accompanied: For the wrongs committed by his Followers and Vaſſals, he would give what ſatisfaction ſhould be required; Concerning the Band of mutual friendſhip betwixt him and ſome Noblemen, they would have adhered together without any writing; they were driven thereunto for their own ſafety, not out of mind to offer, but repel injuries: That he was infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to his goodneſs, in not condemning him before he was heard, and for that he had not lent a credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ear to his enemies miſchievous devices.</p>
               <p>The King replyed, effects and not words make
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:175204:67"/>
the affection and ſubmiſſion of a ſubject known; and could there be any greater ſurety for him, than to rely on the Laws of the Commonwealth and Country? eſpecially (continued he) in a Country where Laws, and not Faction rule, and where a mans own goodneſs is able to preſerve him: But ſuch men as you are, raiſe theſe Factions, to the ſubverſion of all Laws and Authority; and for Subjects to make an offenſive and defenſive League againſt all perſons, is to diſclaim all Government, and do what they pleaſe without controulment; commit Treaſon in the higheſt degree, and make your own Swords and Power juſtifie your proceedings, which, though ye firſt uſe againſt mean perſons, and conceal the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of your actions (for there are degrees in evil, and wicked men begin at that which ſeemeth the leaſt of evils, or not an evil at all at the firſt) your laſt aim is likely to be the robbing upon the Crown: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (my Lord) ye are born under a Monarchy, which admitteth no Soveraignty but it ſelf, and it is natural to Princes to hold it in higheſt eſteem, and in no caſe to ſuffer it to be ſhaken by their Subjects: Take your Prince for your beſt protection, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent life; renounce that Union and League with your Peers, which excepted, or commanded, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, or remitted by your Prince, ſubſiſteth not in Law nor in Reaſon, being forbidden under great pains; and let it not be heard any longer, that ever ſuch an unjuſt Confederation way, and ſo wonted cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency ſhall be preferred before deſerved Juſtice; The Earl replyed, The League being drawn up by the common conſent of many Lords, Barons and Gentlemen, and ſubſcribed, it could not be cancell'd nor renounc'd but by their common conſent; nor was it profitable for the King, nor to him other ways to have it done: That being together, they might
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:175204:68"/>
condeſcend to the renouncing and cancelling of it. But (ſays the King) you to ſhew good example to the reſt, ſhall firſt begin; Neither (living) ſhall any Traytor in my preſence diſavow and diſclaim my Authority, in what is within my poſſibility of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing. The Earl requeſts him to remember, he came to Court upon a publick aſſurance: A pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick aſſurance cannot ſo warrant any man, but that he may fall by his own private miſdemeanor, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King; withal, conſidering a mean courage in a King to be an imputation, and that he did neither wrong towards God nor his Fame, in revenging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the enemies of the State; The place, a ſtrong Caſtle; his preſent power, all within being his Councellors and Servants; the danger if he ſhould eſcape; the eaſineſs of ſuppreſſing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the head taken away: (The Earl continuing hot and ſtubborn, in debating his points of the League, wrath baniſhing other Doubts and Intereſts) his Dagger performed, what armed Juſtice ſcarce da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red attempt: The Kings blow (the noiſe ariſing) was ſeconded by a number of his Servants, who ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Room left him dead, upon Shrewd-Eve, the Twenty ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> One thouſand four hundred fifty two.</p>

Libels are ſpread every where, and the ſafe Conduct of the King and his Council bound to a wooden Truncheon at a Horſes-tail is trailed along the ſtreets: In the Market-place, by the mouth of a Cryer, to the ſound of all their hunting-horns, they declare the King, and thoſe that abode with him, Faith-breakers, perjured perſons, enemies to all goodneſs and good men. <hi>James</hi> the next brother of the houſe of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> (a Church-man) being proclaimed Earl, in rage and madneſs, committing all ſort of Hoſtility; they over-run the Lands and Poſſeſſions of thoſe whom they ſuſpected would ſide the King, and not prove of their party: <hi>John</hi> Lord of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> their Kinſman, and of the name of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege in his Caſtle of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> for that he hated their proceedings; the Tenants and Vaſſals of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> are plundered for the ſame cauſe: The ſtrength of the place raiſed the Siege of <hi>Dalkieth;</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> by their many wrongs and inſolencies, remained more conſtant to the King.</p>
               <p>In this time the King writeth to all the good Towns in the Realm, and Church-men, giving rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the taking away of the Earl, imputing the fault to the Earl himſelf, exhorting the people to make no ſtir for the juſt execution of a Man born for the ruine of the Kingdom, and who voluntarily had precipitated himſelf in his own miſ-hap; offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his power to keep the Country in quietneſs, according to that Authority in which God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: This blow, as particular Intereſts made the hearts of men incline, and as paſſions were various, was variouſly and in ſeveral manners taken. Some without inquiring of circumſtances, after what faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or occaſion ſoever done, allowing it, thought the King had more clear and evident inducements for his deed, then could fall within the Labyrinths of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:175204:69"/>
The Majeſty of a Prince, hardly falleth from an height to a midſt, but eaſily is precipitated from any midſt, to the loweſt degree and ſtation; The King (ſaid they) hath obviated this fall, hath ſet afoot again and raiſed his Authority threatned with ruine; he hath vindicated his liberty almoſt thrall'd, hath aſſured the Lives, Honours, Eſtates of many Loyal Subjects, which were endangered by not adhering to the League of the Earl, and keeping their Oath of Allegiance to the King; he (if he pleaſe now with Honor and Reputation may hold his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, bring to paſs his deſigns for the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Authority, and the peace of his Subjects. Others blamed this Deed every where, and in every circumſtance: laying perjury and murder againſt him, and the breaking of the publick Faith and Aſſurance, the common Band of humane Society, the common defence of all, and the ground of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, that the Earl was not taken away for his paſt demerits and miſdeſervings, but for what he had recently committed in the Kings own preſence, having ſpoken to him with an inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable irreverence: They which have ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, being obliged to ſhun all kind of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him who gives it them, any enormity being ſufficient to annul the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>More, for the breach of Faith, the Earl and his confederates were the more perjured; and he the murtherer of himſelf: they having violated that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Oath to their King, which all Subjects owe to their Soveraigns, by drawing up a League among his People, to the breaking of the tyes of Soveraignty, giving by this, occaſion and juſt cauſe to the King to reward them after their demerits. Moſt ſaid the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Earl was evil, but that it was a neceſſary evil. That as Nature ſuffereth not two Suns, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:175204:69"/>
of State ſuffereth not that in one Kingdom there be Two Kings, but that of neceſſity the one muſt overthrow the other; and matters going thus, he who giveth the firſt blow hath the advantage. Thus did Men judge diverſly, after their proper Intereſts, of the deeds of others.</p>
               <p>The Torrent of theſe diſorders encreaſing, Laws are neglected, Towns Villages, Houſes, the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways are every where afflicted with Rapine, Fire, and Fury, and ſave needy boldneſs, nothing is ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in any place.</p>
               <p>The changing Multitude (like Mad-men limning Pourtraicts with their own blood) delight in their Proceedings, and daily encreaſe the number of the Rebels. In this Inſurrection the King is reduced to many extremities, and is ſaid to have thought upon an eſcape by Sea to <hi>France,</hi> if he had not been diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>James Kennedy,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> who told him, That to leave the Kingdom was to give all over to the inſolency of his Rebels, and for fear of burning, to leap into the fire it ſelf. That beſides the high and long continued Title of a King, which the beſt part of his Subjects yet reverenced, he had ſufficient Friends and Warlike men, who appearing in a Field with him would raiſe a juſt fear in the hearts of thoſe who ſo hainouſly dared diſobey him. That God would be preſent to revenge wronged Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and turn their hopes in deſpair; That the Common People were ever changing, and a little time would make them flow to theſe from whom they did ebb; and all would return again, except ſuch as were guilty of other offences, or ſuch whoſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty made them fear a beggerly Peace as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt puniſhment. That his chiefeſt and principal City ſtood good for him, which example the other Towns would undoubtedly follow; that Rebellion
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:175204:70"/>
was like Thunder, the noiſe of which (if obſerved duely) was often more terrible than the blow, and diſſolved ordinarily in tears of Repentance and fair Weather: that here the prudence of a Prince mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth it ſelf, when he cannot ſuppreſs and ſtop all the evils in his State, to ſuffer and tolerate the leaſt, and with leaſure and time aboliſh and extirpate the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and make vertue of Rebellion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> by the Biſhops Counſel and Aſſiſtance, gathereth an Army, but will not try the hazard of a Battel, before thoſe he had advertiſed and ſent for, ſhould joyn with theſe already about him, and his Forces from all the Quarters of the Kingdom be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the North, the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> had raiſed a goodly Company to come to his aid; but the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> a Confederate of the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> with a power of the men of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> and all who would follow him, guided by ſome <hi>French</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders eſſayed to cut off his paſſage, and rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth him at <hi>Brechen;</hi> the Battel is fought, and the Victory inclined where the Kings Standard was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by the Earl of <hi>Huntley.</hi> The equity of the cauſe laid aſide, the occaſion of this Victory was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to <hi>John Coloſs</hi> of <hi>Bonnymoon,</hi> who having one of the Wings of the Army to guide, which conſiſted of Battel-axes, great Swords, and long Spears, and the beſt invaſive Weapons, in the hotteſt of the Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh gave ground, and left the middle Ward naked upon his ſide: the reaſon of his revolt is reported, that the night before the Battel, when every man was reſolving with his affairs of the World, <hi>Bonnymoon</hi> requeſted the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> of whom he held his Lands-Ward, and relief, ſince the next day he was reſolved, either to be victorious, or die in the Field, to ſubſcribe a Precept (himſelf falling) for entring his Son to his Lands. This the Superiour refuſing, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:175204:70"/>
Vaſſal out of a juſt indignation, when he ſhould have Charged, retired, and his Company with him. Such thoughts poſſeſſed not the Earl of <hi>Huntlies</hi> minde; he dealt not ſo ſparingly with his friends in hope of their good ſervice: To the <hi>Forbeſſes, Oglebies, Leſlies, Grants, Irwines,</hi> he freely gave many of his own Lands, which raiſed their courage to the height. In requital of which, the King after beſtowed upon him the Lands of <hi>Badyeenoch</hi> and <hi>Lochaber.</hi> In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> loſt two Brothers; the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> and Sir <hi>John Lindſay</hi> his brother, being left on the Field, fled to his houſe of <hi>Phanheaven,</hi> where he was heard to ſay, He would be content to remain ſeven years in Hell, to have in ſo timely a ſeaſon done the King his Maſter that Service the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> had performed, and carry that applauſe and thanks he was to receive from him. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict happened upon the Aſcenſion-day, the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of <hi>May,</hi> One thouſand four hundred fifty two.</p>
               <p>The King by the confluence and reſort of many worthy Subjects unto him, having time to breath, and finding himſelf in a calm, keepeth a Convention of the States at <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> Ere the Earls of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs, Crawford, Ormond, Murray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Balve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> and others, are cited to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer according to Law: They inſtead of appearing, in the Night, upon the doors of the Principal Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and other places eminent, fix many Placates and Libels ſigned with their hands; which bear, <hi>The Earl of</hi> Dowglaſs <hi>nor his Followers will never obey Command nor Charge in time coming, nor anſwer ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for that the King is not a juſt Maſter, but a Blood-ſucker, a Murtherer, a Tranſgreſſor of Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a Surpriſer of the Innocent and ſuch who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no harm at his hands:</hi> Not long after the King
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:175204:71"/>
levied an Army, which by the approaching Winter did little Service; and the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> to ſave the Lands of <hi>Beatrice</hi> his Brothers Widow, unſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Houſe, ſought by a Diſpenſation from the Pope to have her in Marriage, alledging her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched of his Brother; which being refuſed him, he kept her in place of his wife, the effect of his <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Divinity, and found hereby more Bryars than Roſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Crawford</hi> placing two ſtricts of Seas betwixt him and the King, ſpoileth the Lands of all thoſe who forſook him at <hi>Brechen;</hi> and <hi>Archembald</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> burneth the Pile of <hi>Srath-Boggy,</hi> pertaining to the Earl of <hi>Huntley;</hi> in revenge of which, the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> burnt and herried all the Lands of the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> beyond the <hi>Spey:</hi> The King too, in this madneſs of Mankind, defaceth his own Country, pulling down the Houſes of his Rebel-Subjects, and waſting <hi>Annan-dale:</hi> This ravage and mutual overturning of all, having continued almoſt two whole years, the Faction of the Earl, far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Kings, now weakned with ſuch laſting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, ſundry of the chief men and heads conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leaſt faults were the beſt, that it was better to ſtrike ſail in time, than make a full ſhipwrack of their Perſons, Honors, and the well of the Kingdom and State, counſel the Earl, that Fervors growing colder, ſince it could not be undone which was done, he would not ſet greater work on foot, but proceeding with conveniency, ſubmit himſelf friendly to the King, who had as much goodneſs as generoſity, and ſought and required nothing of his Subjects but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and having now proved how difficile it was to overcome them by Arms, was (perhaps) as much tyred as they, would pardon theſe faults which he could not otherwiſe amend. Neceſſity in Affairs of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:175204:71"/>
Princes, conſtraining them to yield to many things in Government againſt their firſt Concluſions, and reſolve to grant that which they could not well hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: That there were many hours in the day, and the hearts of Princes were ſubject to change in them; that he ſhould not forſake the Publick-weal of the Kingdom for his private Conſiderations: That after this trouble of State, he might be more eſteemed and ſought after by the King, as it is ordinarily practiſed among Princes and great men, who affect only that which is neceſſary unto them.</p>
               <p>To theſe the Earl anſwered, That they had went too far forwards to think of any cowardly retreat and coming back again; that the only vertue under a Tyrant, was to die conſtantly; that other vertues did fight, but conſtancy alone triumphed: That for himſelf, he would never truſt his life to the mercy of thoſe who under colour of friendſhip and banqueting, had firſt made away his two Kinſmen, and after his own Brother; for if they being Innocents, were thus handled, what might he expect who had been the occaſion of ſuch diſtraction in the State? He that once had broken his faith, except by a ſurety, is unable again (in Law) to contract and enter in Bond with any; who will be ſurety between a King and his Subjects? That Treaties, Agreements, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, Bargains of a Prince with rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, engage him no farther, no longer than the Term-time, or day, which pleaſeth him to accept, obſerve and keep them, as they turn or may turn to his utility and advantage; that as in Nature there is no regreſs found from privation to an habit, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in State men once diſgraced do return to their former Honours: That Princes mortally hated all Subjects who had either attempted to over-rule them by power, or had caſt any terrour upon them; and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:175204:72"/>
howſoever by conſtraint they bear ſail for a time, in the end they were ſure pay-maſters: That there was nothing more contrary to a good Agreement, then to appear to be too earneſt and buſie to ſeek to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; he would ſue for none: That all his days he had loved ſincerity, conſtancy, and fidelity, and could not unſay and recant what he had promiſed and practiſed, nor do againſt his heart: His friends and his own ſtanding was by their Swords, which ſhould either advance their enterprizes and turn them Victor, or they would die Honourably like themſelves and Men, and not ignobly be murdered like Beaſts.</p>
               <p>This free and dangerous reſolution of the Earl, moved many who heard, to provide for their own ſafety, and reſolve not to ſuffer long miſery for other mens folly, finding this war was not like to have any end, and that danger and death would be the only reward of their Rebellion. Amongſt others the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> after great adverſity, when he could not move the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> to ſubmit himſelf to the Kings clemency, with many tears and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his ſincerity love and counſel to him, left him; and ſome weeks after, as the King was in Progreſs in <hi>Anguſs,</hi> in a ſad penitential manner, accompanied with his beſt friends, coming in his way with much humility and ſorrow, He acknowledged his fault, pleading rather for pity to his houſe, which had ſo long flouriſhed, than to his perſon. The King know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his example would be no ſmall occaſion to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the power of the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> and that of all the Rebels he was the greateſt object of his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, was content to receive him, but he would have it done by the mediation of <hi>James Kennedy,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Creightoun,</hi> once his greateſt Enemies, which he refuſed not to embrace. Thus freely remitted with thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:175204:72"/>
him, he returned to his own Houſe of <hi>Phanheaven,</hi> where within few moneths he died of a burning Ague.</p>
               <p>The three Eſtates, after aſſembled at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> the Counteſs <hi>Beatrix,</hi> whom he kept by way of a pretended Marriage, <hi>Archembald Dowglaſs,</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray, George</hi> Earl of <hi>Ormond, John Dowglaſs</hi> Lord of <hi>Balveny,</hi> with others their adherents, friends and followers, are At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of High Treaſon, and their Lands and Goods are Confiſcate and diſcerned to be ſeized on to the Kings uſe. The Earldom of <hi>Murray</hi> is given to <hi>James Creighton,</hi> who had married the eldeſt Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Murray;</hi> but he perceiving he could not poſſeſs it in peace, turned it back again to the King. At this time <hi>George Creightoun</hi> was created Earl of <hi>Caithneſs; William Hay</hi> Conſtable Earl of <hi>Arrol, Darly, Halles, Boyd, Lyle</hi> and <hi>Lorn,</hi> Lords of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the King maketh a rode into <hi>Galloway,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing every ſtrong hold and Caſtle of the Country to his Power; <hi>Dowglaſs-dale</hi> he abandoned to the ſpoil of the Souldier.</p>
               <p>Matters at home turning deſperate, the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> being brought to that paſs, that he knew not what to wiſh or fear, <hi>James Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yow</hi> is ſent to <hi>England</hi> to invite the ancient enemy of the kingdom to take a part of her ſpoil, and help to trouble the King. But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had greater buſineſs amongſt themſelves than could permit them to Wed the Quarrels of the Earl. After Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> was returned with an excuſe, and regret that ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords could not ſupply their confuſion, but only by their counſel, he adviſed the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> to truſt to his own Power and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were ſufficient, meaſuring their Courage, and not counting their Heads, to hold good againſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:175204:73"/>
the King. There was no human affairs where men were not neceſſitated to run ſome danger, nor any buſineſs taken in hand with ſuch a certainty, which by unknown cauſes, and even light ones, might not run a hazard of ſome miſhap; That he ſhould ſtudy to embrace and accept of what was moſt honourable and leaſt dangerous: it was better once to try the worſt, then ever to be in fear of it: it was fit for him to commit ſomething to fortune, and wiſdom could counſel nothing but to ſhun the greateſt evil. This lingring war would not only tire, but over-come and vanquiſh them, when one fair day of battel, either by death or victory would crown their deſires. Others adviſed him, not to hazard upon a Battel, except up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeen and approved advantage, and to time it out a while; in this lingring War a Truce might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, which ere long might turn in a Peace, in which every thing paſſed might be forgotten and pardoned; That Wars were managed more by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and times than by arms; That the King could not be now but tyred, ſince he had learned, that by eſſaying by arms to overcome them he had gained nothing but trained up his Subjects, whom he called Rebels, in all Warlike Diſcipline, and had his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſpoiled and the Policy defaced. Should they once enter in blood, all hopes were gone of any conditions of peace.</p>
               <p>At this time the King beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn,</hi> to relieve the beſieged, hither marcheth with all his Forces the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs;</hi> being come within view of the Kings Army, he obſerveth their march ſlow, the countenance of his Souldiers altered, much whiſpering, and their ſpirits in a manner dejected. Countrymen were to Fight againſt Countrymen, friends againſt friends, and all againſt their Prince. Interpreting this rather to proceed from their weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:175204:73"/>
than want of good will to enter the Liſts, as well to refreſh and cheriſh them to be more prompt and luſty of courage the next morning, as to take counſel what courſe to follow, and how to diſpoſe of their Game, he ſtayeth that afternoon and pitcheth his Tents. To men unfortunate every thing turneth an enemy. Whether Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> gave way to this, or not, uncertain; but after (it is ſaid) that in a chafe he told the Earl, he had neglected the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Fight, and ſhould never ſee ſo fair a day again, in which he might have hazarded one caſt of a Dye for a whole Kingdom. But his Fortune was now declined, and (perhaps,) would never ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; that by giving that night to his Souldiers to pauſe and deliberate on the matter, they would (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance) take the ſafeſt way, be more adviſed what to enterpriſe the next morning, readily not Fight at all, conſiſting of a number of bold young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Volunteers, who for the moſt part out of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and compaſſion followed him; That the Kings Army by his lingring and lying off was encouraged, finding they were to cope with men who would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ere they fought. After which ſpeeches he bad the Earl farewel: And now, knowing that the way lay open both for Pardon and Favour to him that would firſt ſeek it, he in the night breaketh out with ſome friends, and having got over the fields betwixt the two Camps, was brought ſafely to the King, who graciouſly received, and freely pardoned him: The Army having underſtood the clandeſtin Revolt and eſcape of Sir <hi>James Hamilton,</hi> disbanded, every man ſlipping away by ſecret paſſages to his own habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that on the morrow there was nothing to be ſeen but the ſolitary field upon which they had encamped: The King out of joy of this bloodleſs Victory, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Proclaim in all his chief Towns, <hi>That ſince Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign

the Caſtle ſurpriſed, Murders, Raviſhings, Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with what inſolency the barbarous Canibals could commit, are every where, and the ſad image of death ravageth amongſt the common people: The Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> now at his laſt ſhifts and efforts, leaveth no ſhifts nor helps unſought out; ſuch who lived upon prey and ſpoil reſort unto him; he maketh hot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, and after a moſt hoſtile manner, which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth him the hatred of all his Country-men, and turned thoſe who were indifferent in his quarrel, his profeſſed enemies: this ravage continuing, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> (after ſlain at <hi>Caxtoun</hi>-field) whom love of the valor of the Houſe of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,</hi> and the true commiſeration, had brought to take arms with him, invadeth one quarter of the <hi>Marſh,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> turneth towards another: But whilſt they are diſperſed, and more eager and intentive to carry away ſpoil, than to look to their own ſafety and military diſcipline, the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> with Sir <hi>James Hamilton</hi> of <hi>Cadyow,</hi> put them both (with number and confuſion overborn) to flight, ſlaying many, and taking more Priſoners: After this overthrow, during the Kings reign, the Earl of <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> deliberating not to oppoſe longer to neceſſity, but to be ſtill till better times, never attempted to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade his Country.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe incurſions, the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> is beheaded: the Counteſs of <hi>Dowglaſs, Beatrice</hi> (all hopes being loſt of reſtoring her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) deſpoiled of her Lands and fair Heritage, turned now a Monſter of Fortune, the blame of her unlawful Wedlock laid upon the Earl, conſented to by her out of a certain fear of her life, ſubmitted her ſelf to the Kings Clemency.

and the obſtinate remain the leſs powerful and weak, receiveth her; and giveth her in Marriage to his Brother <hi>John,</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> ſon to the Black Knight of <hi>Lorne,</hi> deſigning for her Dowry the Lordſhip of <hi>Balveny.</hi>

               <p>By her example the Counteſs of <hi>Roſs,</hi> abhorring the fierceneſs and cruelties (as ſhe gave out) of her barbarous Husband, but rather out of policy to be an Agent for him, flyeth to the King, and hath Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues allowed her for the maintenance of her Eſtate.

The King by his great prudence, and the courſe of the affairs of his Kingdom, knew that it was neceſſary ſometimes to condeſcend to the imperfections and faults of ſome Subjects, and having compaſſion, apply and accomodate himſelf to that which though according to the ſtrictneſs of equity was not due, yet for the preſent occaſion and reaſon of State was convenient, anſwered, he would neither altogether pardon him, nor flatly reject him, there being many ſigns of his wickedneſs, few of his chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged mind; when honeſtly without fraud or guile, he ſhould crave a Pardon, and give ſatisfaction to thoſe whom by blood and pillage he had wronged and by ſome noble action deface the remembrance of his former crimes, then ſhould it be good time to receive him. Notwithſtanding this ſhould not diſcourage him, but he ſhould know he had a deſire to make him reliſh the effects of his bounty, ſo he himſelf would find the means and ſubject. In this interim he wiſhed him to keep the common peace of the Country, and not oppreſs any of his Neighbours. About this time

               <p>The King partly having looſed, partly cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that Gordian knot of the League of his Nobility, began to reobtain again the ancient Authority of the Kings his Predeceſſours, giving and impoſing Laws to his Subjects, according to reaſon and greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.

               <p>Who will take a fair view of this Prince, ſhall find him to have been endowed with what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and qualities are to be deſired or wiſhed in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, both for mind and body, of an excellent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and pleaſant aſpect, aſtrong vigorous complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, given to all Knightly exerciſes: He is ſaid to have had a broad red ſpot upon one of his cheeks, from which by his Country-men he was named <hi>James with the fiery face,</hi> which would make Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomiſts conceive, he was of an hot, active, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent diſpoſition, and one who had more need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint than encouragement in all difficulties; yet in his actions we find him temperate, ſtayed, and of a well ſetled humor, proceeding upon ſound grounds, and after mature deliberation; being much given to follow the advice and counſel of grave men about him; He was upright, ſincere, affable, courteous, loving to his Domeſticks, human towards his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, gracious and benign to all men, a lover of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:175204:79"/>
liberal, but without oppreſſion of his loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; wiſe, in adverſity induſtrious and diligent, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick in affairs of State; having always raiſed up one Faction to relieve him from the hazard and burthen of another, and expoſe the Faction he moſt feared to the neareſt hazard: He was wiſely diffident, and put on a judicial diſtruſt, often to be governed as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſhould vary, and could diſſimulate according to the faſhions and changes of the time: He ſeemeth to have been indifferent in keeping his Favorites, and that he could ever as well transfer his fancy, as he had ſetled his affection; For like the Sun he would make a round, and not always ſhine upon the Horizon.</p>
               <p>The death of the two Earls of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to him; and though he was innocent of the firſt, the ſecond chanced deſervedly in his hand; Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Princes are not to be provoked by any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject how great ſoever: Confederations and Leagues are fearful attempts againſt Soveraignty, and for the moſt part end with the ruine of their Authors: The extirpation of the Earls of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> in the perſon of <hi>James</hi> (a Churchman) proceeded rather from his own ſtubbornneſs, than any male-talent the King had againſt him. In all Nations it is obſerved, that there are ſome Families fatal to the ruine of their Common-wealths, and ſome perſons fatal to the ruine of the Houſes and Race of which they are deſcended: Since in Kingdoms ſome have no compaſſion of their Prince, nor the loſs of his Honour, a Prince ſhould not much regret their loſs, nor the ruine of their perſons and Eſtates: His great clemency appeared in this, That the heads taken away of that long Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, he followed no particular revenge upon their followers, not only granting Pardons, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the offences; knowing it was better to heal and cure the faulty and ſick members of a State, than
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:175204:79"/>
to aboliſh and cut them away; and more valour for a Prince to overcome his own paſſions and juſt wrath, than to vanquiſh and ſubdue his proudeſt enemies; yet was not his clemency a ſoft weakneſs, it being no leſs cruelty to forgive all, than to ſpare none, but an order and diſcretion in Juſtice, temperate with ſeverity towards ſome more than towards others; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their demerits: He was very ſenſible of the afflictions of ſuch as was diſtreſſed, as witneſs the Counteſſes of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> and <hi>Roſs:</hi> His life having ſet in the Orient of his Age and hopes, he deſerveth in the Records of Memory and Fame, a place amongſt the beſt but unfortunate Princes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That providence which brought me upon the Earth, and ſet a Crown on my head, doth now recal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move me to a better Kingdom; and my happineſs is not in this a little, that I leave this life without change of that Eſtate in which I peaceably lived. Death now ſheweth me as in a mirrour, the frailty of all worldly Pomp and glory, which before by the marble colours of falſe greatneſs was over-ſhadowed and covered from me. My Griefs have been many, few my contentments: The moſt eminent of which, was the hopes I conceived of you, and my other children: and now my greateſt regret is, that I leave you before I could ſee my wiſhes accompliſhed towards you. My only care was to have you brought up in all vertue, and goodneſs: But Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall beſtow that charge to more prudent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. Always take theſe motherly directions from me, who can leave you no better Legacy. Be earneſt to obſerve theſe Commandments which are preſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by Religion, for this ſupporteth the Scepters of Princes: and a Religious King cannot but have obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Subjects. What an unreaſonable thing is it, that a King will have a People to acknowledge him for their Soveraign Prince upon Earth, and will not acknowledge God for his Supream Lord in Heaven? A King who rebelleth againſt God, all ſubordinate Creatures will rebel againſt him. Love my children, and laying aſide the Port and Statelineſs of a King, receive them with the affection of a Brother. Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make your Subjects obey you more out of Love than Fear: or make your ſelf beloved and feared both together, ſeeing love alone of it ſelf is often cauſe of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:175204:85"/>
contempt, and fear alone begets hatred. Remember ye Govern not the ſoft effeminate People of the</hi> South, <hi>but a fierce Warlike Nation of the</hi> North, <hi>which oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner uſe to be entreated than commanded by their Princes. Be ſparing to lay Subſidies on them, which maketh many Male-contents; and live upon your own, ſuffering others to enjoy what is theirs: Beware of Flatterers, and exalting undeſerved perſons above your ancient Nobility. Suffer not your Prerogatives to come in Queſtion; but fore-ſeeing the danger, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give way to all that with reaſon is demanded of you. Moderate your Paſſions; He ſhall never Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern a Kingdom, who cannot govern himſelf, and bring his Affections within the Circle of Reaſon. It fears me, Envy and Malice arm themſelves againſt you, which to overcome, endeavour to be Martial in your ſelf; for a Prince that is not Martial in himſelf, ſhall never be freed of Rebellion amongſt his Subjects: a ſtrong arm ſhould hold the Ballance of Juſtice: When diſſention ariſeth, be not a Loyterer and Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but with all celerity ſuppreſs it in the Infancy. Rebellion is like Fire in a City, which ſhould be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though with the pulling down of the Neighbour Houſes: Others will inſtruct you in the art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with greater curioſity and wiſdom, but not with the like love and affection. I wiſh this counſel be ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in your heart and conſcience after my death, for a perpetual teſtimony of my ſincerity in your education. And if by the unjuſt counſel of others, ye be brought to practiſe ought contrary to theſe inſtructions, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ye cannot ſhun inevitable dangers both to your State and Perſon. But now I am warned from above to deliver this grief-ful Body to the reſt of a deſired Grave.</hi>

               <p>The King as he encreaſed in years, encreaſing in ſtrength and ability for exerciſes either of recreation or valour, by the Regents is given to a Brother of the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> to be bred in Knightly Proweſs; a man ſingular for his Education abroad and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor at home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The <hi>Kennedies</hi> were now aged, and become tyred to give ſuch aſſiduous attendance at Court as they were wont, and the times required. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> by the weakneſs of his Co-partners governed the State alone, as Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the young King. To whoſe Natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation he did ſo comply and conform himſelf, that he had the whole truſt of his affairs, and the <hi>King</hi> had no thoughts but his. So ſoon as the King began to know himſelf, he turned impatient of being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Laws of Minority, that he himſelf ſhould be reſtrained by that Authority which did derive from him, to loath the Superintendency and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, and to affect an unſeaſonable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be at his own diſpoſal and the governing himſelf. Many things are done without the advice of the Governours, and occaſion is ſought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened of their Authority. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> and his Brother in a little time encreaſing in greatneſs, and having an intention to transfer the Power of the State and Glory of the Court to their Family, fail not to find opportunity to free the King from the ſeverity and rigour of the Governours Schooling, and to frame him an eſcape. Whilſt the King remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hayls,</hi> Lord <hi>Somervail,</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Carre</hi> of <hi>Chesford,</hi> Sir <hi>Alexander Boyd,</hi> agree upon a match of Hunting, and will have the King Umpire of the Game; Early, the morning

following, the Gentlemen who were upon the Plot failed not in their Attendance. The King being a mile off the Town, and holding the way towards <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the Lord <hi>Kennedy,</hi> whoſe quarter then was to attend, and who had leaſurely followed, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting this Hunting to be a Game of State, the King continuing his Progreſs, laying his hands upon the Reins of his Bridle, requeſted him to turn again to <hi>Linlithgow;</hi> for that he perceived the time was not convenient for him to go further, neither was he at a convenient match in abſence of his beſt deſerving followers: Sir <hi>Alexander Boyd</hi> impatient that the King ſhould have been thus ſtayed, after injurious words ſtroke the Reverend Governour with a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-ſtaff upon the head, and took the King along with him to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> At a frequent meeting of the States, the <hi>Kennedies</hi> urged to have the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under Minority, the <hi>Boyds</hi> to take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his own Perſon; after long conteſtations, wiſdom being overcome by boldneſs, the Authority of the better party was forced to give place, and yield to the will of the greater. Thus the Faction of the <hi>Boyds</hi> prevailed.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Kennedies</hi> full of indignation, and breathing Revenge, leave the Court; cares, grief and age about this time brought <hi>James Kennedy,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to his Tomb, which in great mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence he had raiſed in a Church builded by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the City of St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> where alſo he Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Colledge of Philoſophy, and endowed it with many Priviledges, and ſufficient Endowments to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Profeſſors. By the death of this Prelate, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable for his Wiſdom, ſingular for his Juſtice, and the tranquillity following his Government, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent in all his actions, the glory of the Court and Country ſuffered a great Eclipſe.</p>

upon them all Offices of State, and adding power to ſuch who wanted only will to do miſchief, except that they knew well how to abaſe and pull them down again, making their fall the more ſudden. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> having the Reins of Government in his hands, and the cuſtody of the Kings Siſter, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelld with the Golden Sun of honour, to lay more ſure the foundation of his greatneſs, joyneth in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <hi>Thomas</hi> his eldeſt <hi>Son,</hi> a youth of extraordinary endowments, both of mind and body, with <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> the Kings eldeſt Siſter; Not long before deſigned by her Mother to have been given in Marriage to <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and he is created Earl of <hi>Arran.</hi> The Father knowing how eaſily the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of young perſons breedeth a liking, had brought them up together, which turning in a love and delight of others company, concluded laſt in Marriage. This match though royal, great and rich, inſtead of ſupporting the Fortunes of the <hi>Boyds</hi> much weakned them, turning them the objects of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. The Nobles repined at it, and the common people (lighter than the wind and more variable than the Rain-bow) made it the ſubject of their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh diſcourſes. Now (ſaid they) the <hi>Boyds</hi> aſpire to the Crown; for the King with his Brothers removed it appertaineth to them, a Kingdom being the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often of a Wife of the blood Royal. The <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and ſuch who diſliked the preſent Government take the occaſion of the diſcontentment of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the Rumors of the people, to ſhake the Kings mind towards the Governour, and change the brawl of State. To this end they give way to great and univerſal oppreſſions, moſt of which were hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and occaſioned by themſelves. By theſe in a ſhort time the Commons turn licentious and diſſolute, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all Government, every man doing what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:175204:88"/>
ſeemed beſt in his own eyes, and the Gentry divide in Factions: Such who wont to live upon Rapine and Theft returned to their wonted Trades: honeſt men are ſpoiled of their goods; the ſeditious and wicked are maintained and defended againſt all Laws and Juſtice by their Parties. The State thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and all order confounded, by ſlie and crafty men, who at firſt pretended great friendſhip and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt towards the <hi>Boyds,</hi> the Kings affection towards them is aſſailed, and reſolutions tryed. Many times having been plauſibly liſtened unto, at laſt, pulling off their masks, they lay imputations againſt them. They remonſtrate to him what great diſparagement was between the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> eldeſt Siſter and the Son of the Lord <hi>Boyd;</hi> that by this match he was robbed of one of the faireſt jewels of his Crown; the <hi>Boyds</hi> ſhould not have appropriated that to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of which they had only the keeping; ſhe ſhould have been reſerved for ſome Neighbour Prince, by which Alliance the State of the Kingdom, and the Perſon of the King might have been in great ſafety. For, if the King ſhould chance to be infeſted by ſome inſolent Nobility, the name and power of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince were ſufficient to keep him ſafe on his Throne, which by this match was endangered. They ſuggeſted that the <hi>Boyds</hi> builded their eſtimation in the air of popular applauſe, and endeavoured to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear themſelves in the opinion of the multitude. A Prince is not a Lord of that people that loveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beter than him. Should the <hi>Boyds</hi> be accuſed of peculate and robbing the King and the common Treaſure, the King might make a prey of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful conqueſt, and by their Attaindors reward the ſervices of many of his neceſſitated friends, it being acquired moſt part by ſpoils and the taxing of the Subjects unlawfully. The height to which their
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:175204:89"/>
riches was encreaſed ſhould be feared; the faults of all the diſorders of the Commonwealth are laid upon the <hi>Boyds,</hi> as the Authors of every breaking out and ſedition: that they might the more ſecurely poſſeſs the places near the King. At this time complaints from all parts of the Kingdom, and by all ſorts of perſons, inceſſantly being given unto him, advance the intentions of their Enemies, and the Kings mind, naturally inclined to fears and ſuperſtition, being long toſſed and perplexed, began to turn away from the <hi>Boyds,</hi> and with their power in ſome degrees brought lower and leſſened (Preambles of Ruine) but he would go leaſurely to produce this effect and make one change bring forth another.</p>
               <p>The King encreaſing in years and youthful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, is counſelled for the continuing of the Race and Succeſſion, and the keeping his Perſon without the common diſorders of the world, to think upon ſome match profitable for his Country, and honourable for himſelf. He is courted by many, and courteth others; the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> had offered him his Daughter, as to other Princes his friends and neighbours, but his mind was not to have her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at all during his life-time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Andrew Stwart</hi> Lord <hi>Evandale,</hi> then Chancellour of the Kingdom, with the Biſhops of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Orknay,</hi> being ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Chriſtern</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for an accommodation, and taking up ſome buſineſs concerning the Iſles of <hi>Orkenay</hi> and <hi>Schythland</hi> One thouſand four hundred ſixty eight, the quarrel was taken away by a marriage to be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated between the King and Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> King <hi>Chriſterns</hi> daughter; a Lady thought worthy of his bed, in reſpect of the excellency of her beauty, her royal deſcent and greatneſs of her birth. All mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters being agreed upon, theſe Iſles engaged for her
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:175204:89"/>
Dowry, there wanted only an honourable retinue and convoy to bring home the Lady. To this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, by the craft of ſome about the King, and vanity of others, who gloried to ſee their friend pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to ſuch great honour, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> as a man flouriſhing in fame and riches, and able to maintain and diſcharge all magnificence, is depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the fitteſt perſon. Thus by the ambition and unattentiveneſs of his friends, his worth was made the Scaffold of his Ruine; the lamentable condition of men of high deſert. In the beginning of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, accompanied with ſome young Noblemen and Gallants, moſt of which were his ſelect friends and well-wiſhers, he aſcendeth his ſhips. Whilſt as the King of <hi>Scotlands</hi> brother in law, he is ſome months riotouſly entertained at the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Court, the rigor of that <hi>Northern</hi> Climate, by the congealing of the Ocean moored up his ſhips, and barred all return till the following Spring. In this abſence of a man ſo near unto the King, his Father and Uncle, by age, ſickneſs and their private affairs, not ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunting the Court as they were accuſtomed: the <hi>Kennedyes</hi> and they of the contrary Faction having ſhaken the Kings affection, and broken theſe bands (his pleaſures, idleneſs, and vacancy from the publick affairs of the State) by which the <hi>Boyds</hi> thought they had kept him ſure, move him, now a little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in action, to proceed to the conſideration of ſuch matters as might be objected againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Boyds.</hi> But that this might not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be an act of Faction, but the univerſal conſent of the Kingdom apart, a Parliament was ſummoned to be holden in <hi>November</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Here <hi>Robert</hi> Lord <hi>Boyd,</hi> with his brother Sir <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> are ſummoned to anſwer in Judgment to ſuch points as ſhould be exhibited againſt them. At the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:175204:90"/>
appointed day the Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> appeared, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſuch multitude of the common people, and numbers of his friends, vaſſals, and followers all in arms, with ſuch oſtentation and boaſting, that the King and Courtiers were well pleaſed to ſuffer them diſſolve and ſcatter of their own free wills. At this inſolency and malepartneſs (yet to our own time an uſual cuſtom in <hi>Scotland</hi>) the King conceived ſuch indignation, that he raiſed a ſtrong guard to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend juſtice and his commandments, and laid ſecretly Forces to aſſiſt theſe if the <hi>Boyds</hi> ſhould oppoſe his laws by convocation of the Lieges. The Lord <hi>Boyd</hi> after private intelligence of the Minds of the Court to blow him up, rather amazed than in choler at the change of his Maſters mind, fled into <hi>England;</hi> his brother Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> areſted by ſickneſs, and relying upon his own integrity more than he ought to have done, conſidering the malice of his enemies, was brought before the Parliament; his brother and he were challenged, that upon the tenth of <hi>July</hi> One thouſand four hundred ſixty ſix, they laid hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings Perſon, and againſt his purpoſe brought him off the high way to the Caſtle of <hi>Calendar;</hi> and that by their private power and conſent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the eſtabliſhed order of the State, and the other Regents advice, they brought the King to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> when Sir <hi>Alexander</hi> ſought to produce an act of Parliament for abolition of approbation of this deed as good ſervice, it was kept up, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned had his Head cut off. Their other accuſations contained the topical faults of Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, that they had enriched themſelves out of the Kings Treaſure, monopolized things belonging to the Crown, diminiſhed the Revenues thereof, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved worthy men from the Council, placing ſuch in their rooms as had dependency from them. <hi>Thomas</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> being ſlow to action, and more inclined to a ſolitary form of Life, than to travel and buſineſs; his brothers being Princes of unquiet and reſtleſs Spirits, to whom publick imployments were recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">1469.</note> and withal being ambitious, prodigal, deſirous of Rule, and to be Governours of the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and Kings in fact, however their elder brother was in title; they ſet themſelves altogether to ſtudy novations, and bring the King in contempt with his Subjects, and divert their minds and love towards him. To this effect they had drawn by their toward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:175204:92"/>
and familiarity, many of the young Nobles and Gentlemen to follow them. The King was obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to ſome publick Scandals, for by his too great frugality, care to encreaſe his Treaſure, and ſtudy of Purchaſing by Taxations, ſale of Church Benefices, and too exact taking up of Fines, ſupervaluation of Wards; he had gotten the name of Covetous, and was no ſmall diſtaſt amongſt the Commons. <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> that the <hi>Scots</hi> by the inſtigation of the <hi>French,</hi> ſhould not trouble his new and ſcarce ſettled government, imploying all his counſels and diligence to divide them amongſt themſelves, wrought not a little on the unquiet Spirits of theſe young men. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> having been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon the Seas by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was honourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by him, and with great hopes ſent home; after which time King <hi>Edward</hi> and he kept always private Intelligence together. The Duke being promoted to the keeping of the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar</hi> and Town of <hi>Berwick;</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate himſelf in his affection, was wont to whiſper unto ſuch who loved him, That if his Brother kept not fair with <hi>England,</hi> he would one day ſet him in his Place upon his Royal Throne.</p>
               <p>At this time the King was ſerved by men whom his opinion of their worth and love towards him had advanced to places, and whoſe Fortunes and Eſtates wholly depended upon his ſafety, and who were leſs apt to do him harm. His counſel was likewiſe of men approved for their affection to him; and thus ſecluding great men from his familiarity and affairs, he gave them cauſe of offence. His brothers long masking their ambition under diſcontentment, ſtir the Male-contents to complain againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ordinarily falleth forth, not becauſe a people is not well governed, but becauſe great ones
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:175204:93"/>
would govern themſelves. Theſe upbraided the King with inglorious ſloath, and endeavour by his diſhonour to encreaſe the credit of his Brothers. Theſe ſpared not to ſpeak evil of him every where, and what they pleaſed of his Miniſters and Favourites; they ſaid he neither uſed rule nor moderation in his proceedings, that his counſel was baſe, and of men of no great account, who conſulted only to humour him; That a Maſon ſwayed a Kingdom (this was <hi>Robert Cochranne,</hi> a man couragious and bold, firſt known to the King by his valour in a ſingle Combat, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from an Architect or Surveyor of his buildings, preferred to be of his counſel) a ſilly wretch ſwayed the ſoul of a great King, and curbed it, as it were interdicted or charmed to his pleaſure. His contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were the rewards of Paraſites, to whom fortune, not merit gave growth and augmentation; that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours wept over ſuch baſe men who had not deſerved them; and the ſtately frames of ancient houſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided with reproaches the ſlender merits of thoſe new-up-ſtarts who enjoyed them; that he began to look downwards into every ſordid way of enriching himſelf: That his Privadoes abuſed him in every thing, but in nothing more than in making him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, what was plotting againſt them, was againſt his Perſon and Authority; and that it was not them his brothers and the Nobility ſought to pull down but his Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>His counſellors, ſervants, and ſuch who loved him, having long buſied their wits to ſave their Maſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and that no ſhadow of weakneſs ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the common People, underſtanding by whom theſe rumours were firſt ſpread abroad, and obſerving many of the Nobility and Gentry to favour the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of his brothers, not daring diſcloſe themſelves to the King what their ſuſpicions made them fear
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:175204:93"/>
would come to paſs, knowing him naturally ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, an admirer and believer of Divinations, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orn an aged woman one morning as he went a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to approach him, and tell, ſhe had by Divination, that he ſhould beware of his neareſt kinſmen; that from them his ruine was likely to come. This was no ſooner told when the Woman was ſhifted, and ſome who were upon the Plot began to comment the Propheſie of his brothers. A Profeſſor of Phyſick, for his skill in Divination brought from <hi>Germany,</hi> and promoted to ſome Church-benefice, about that ſame time told the King, That in <hi>Scotland</hi> a Lyon ſhould be devoured by his Whelps. <hi>William Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vez,</hi> then Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> by way of Aſtrological predictions, put him in a fear of immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers from his kindred, though truly he had his knowledge from Geomancy and good informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon earth, by the intelligence between the Nobility and Churchmen.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch like aſperſions being laid upon the King, the people cryed out that he had only for his fellow-companions Aſtrologers and Sooth-ſayers, whom as occaſion ſerved, he preferred to the Church-benefices, and Biſhopricks. <hi>Patrick Graham,</hi> then Priſoner in <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> a man deſolate and forgotten, as if there had not been ſuch a man in the world, taking the opportunity of the rumours of the time, ſent a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the King, which contained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the miſery, of his impriſonment, was not ſo grievous unto him as the ſad reports which he heard of his Majeſties eſtate; he was hardly brought to believe them, but by his long detention and impriſonment, he was aſſured his great enemy was in great credit with him. That he had brought the King very low in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him jealous of his brothers by giving truſt to his vain Divinations; and no wonder theſe Arts bring
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:175204:94"/>
forth diſſentions, which have their precepts from the father of lyes and diſcord: to foment diſcord among brothers, was reproachful to Religion, and outragious to Policy; to ſeek to know things to come by the Stars was great ignorance, that Oracles leave a man in a wilderneſs of folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there was no other difference betwixt Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy and Aſtrology, ſaving that in one, men run vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to the Devil, and in the other ignorantly. Humanity attains not to the ſecrets above, and if it did, it is not wiſe enough to divert the wiſdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is not to be reſiſted, but ſubmitted unto; that never any had recourſe to theſe arts, but they had fatal ends; That almighty providence permitting that to befall them out of his juſtice of neceſſity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Oracle was ſought, was ſcarce contingent; that he ſhould reſt upon the Almighties Providence, and then all things would ſucceed well with him, whoſe favors would waſt him out of the ſurges of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>

               <p>After this free opening of his mind, <hi>Patrick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was removed out of <hi>Dumfermling</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Loch-leven</hi> (a place renowned long after by the impriſonment of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland</hi>) where in a ſhort time he left the miſeries of this world.</p>
               <p>The people now throughly deceived and incenſed againſt their King, the moſt audacious of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had brought his brothers on the way of taking the Government to themſelves, their power being able to perform what their ambition projected; and the murmuring of the people ſeeming to applaud any Inſurrections. The Earl of <hi>Marr,</hi> young and raſh, purblind in foreſeeing the events of things, is ſtirred up to begin the Tragedy; ſome of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Faction being preſent, with more liberty than wiſdom, he broke out in menacing and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:175204:94"/>
ſpeeches, as that his brother did wrong to his Majeſty in keeping near him, and being ſo familiar with ſuch contemptible fellows, as theſe of his Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber and Officers; withal, railing againſt the Government of the State and Court. The King paſſionately reſenting his words, cauſed remove him From his preſence, and he perſevering in his railing, was committed to the Caſtle of <hi>Craigmillar,</hi> where ſurmiſing that he was in a Priſon, his anger turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rage, his rage kindled a Feaver, and his Feaver advanced to a Phrenſie: This ſickneſs encreaſing, that he might be more neer to the Court and his friends, in the Night he is tranſported to the Cannons Gate in <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> the King compaſſionate of his diſeaſe, ſendeth his Phyſitians to attend him; they to reſtore his underſtanding which was moleſted, open ſome veins of his head and arms, in which time whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his own diſorder or miſgovernment in his ſickneſs, the bands being looſed which tyed the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or that they took too great a quantity of blood from him, he fainted, and after ſowning, died un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares amongſt the hands of his beſt friends and ſervants. Theſe who hated the King, gave out that he was taken away by his command, and ſome Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have recorded the ſame; but no ſuch faith ſhould be given unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to <hi>B.

For the Kings Image being framed in Wax, and with many ſpels and incantations baptized, and ſet unto a

fire, they perſwaded themſelves the Kings perſon ſhould fall away as that Image conſumed by the fire, and by the death of the King, the brothers ſhould reach the Government of the State; with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities was the common people amuſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> imputing the death of his brother to the favourites of the King, and a vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to have been the occaſioners of his diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtirred the Nobility and People to revenge ſo foul a deed; but whilſt he keeps private meetings with them of his Faction in the Night to facilitate their enterpriſe, betrayed by ſome of his followers, he is ſurpriſed and impriſoned in the Caſtle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> Out of which about the appointed time of his tryal, by the killing of his keeper he eſcaped, and in a Ship which to that effect was hired, ſailing to the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> of which he had the keeping, he paſſed to <hi>France.</hi> After the eſcape of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> the Lord <hi>Evandale</hi> Chancellour of the Kingdom, raiſing the power of the neareſt Shires, beleagured the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar:</hi> the beſieged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of Victuals, as men expecting no ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, betake themſelves in ſmall Boats to the Sea, and came ſafe towards the Coaſts of <hi>England.</hi> The Caſtle having none to defend it, is taken; ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in purſuit of the flying ſouldiers, by their own raſhneſs periſhed.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> toſſed along with civil troubles, and affecting peace with all their neighbours, by an equal and mutual conſent of thoughts ſend at one time Ambaſſadors to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who firſt conclude a Peace between the two Nations; and that the Poſterity might be partakers of this accord, contract afterwards an Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings. It was agreed that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs <hi>Cicilia</hi> youngeſt daughter to King <hi>Edward,</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:175204:95"/>
ſhould marry with <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> when they came to years of diſcretion. A motion heard with great acceptance; but it was thought by ſome familiar with King <hi>Edward</hi> and in his moſt inward Counſels, that really he never intended this marriage, and that this negotiation aimed only to temporize with <hi>Scotland,</hi> in caſe that <hi>Louys</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſhould ſtir up an Invaſion of <hi>England</hi> by the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> King <hi>Louys</hi> at this time had ſent one Doctor <hi>Ireland</hi> a <hi>Sorboniſt</hi> to move King <hi>James</hi> to trouble the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and to give over the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected marriage; which when King <hi>Edward</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, knowing what a diſtance was between things promiſed and performed, to oblige King <hi>James,</hi> and tye him more ſtrongly to the bargain, that this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage might have more ſway, he cauſed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent maintenance of the Prince, and as it were a part of the Dowry of Lady <hi>Cicilia,</hi> deliver certain ſums of money to King <hi>James.</hi> Notwithſtanding of which benevolence the witty <hi>Louys</hi> wrought ſo with the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility, that King <hi>James</hi> ſent Embaſſadors to the King of <hi>England,</hi> entreating him not to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> his brother in Law againſt King <hi>Lovys,</hi> which if he refuſed to do, the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> who were now turned inſolent, would conſtrain him by reaſon of the ancient League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> during his abode in <hi>France,</hi> had married a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Bulloigne</hi> (ſhe was his ſecond Wife, his firſt having been a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earl of <hi>Orkenay,</hi> a Lady of great Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and many Friends) who inceſſantly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King <hi>Lovys</hi> to aid the Duke for the recovery of his Inheritance and places in the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of which he was kept by the evil Counſellors of his brother <hi>Louys</hi> minding to make good uſe of his
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:175204:96"/>
brother, and underhand increaſing diſcords and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies between him and the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſuits told him, he could not juſtifie his taking of Arms to ſettle a Subject in his Inheritance; That Princes ought to be wrought upon by perſuaſion, not violence, and he ſhould not trouble a King other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways then by Prayers and Petitions, which he would be earneſt to perform. Upon this refuſal the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> (having buried his Dutcheſs) troubled with new thoughts came to <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> with accuſtomated courteſies receiving him, giveth him hopes of aſſiſtance, entring of in communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him how to divert the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from the invaſion of his Dominions at the deſire of the <hi>French,</hi> the Agents and traffickers of <hi>Louys</hi> lying ſtill in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and daily bribing and ſoliciting the <hi>Scots</hi> Nobility to neceſſitate the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſtay at home. The Duke freely, and in the worſt ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the weakneſs of his Kingdom, that his King was opinionative, and had nothing of a Prince in him but the Name: His ungoverned Spirit diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to liſten to the temperate Counſel of ſober men, obeying only his own judgment. Such who govern'd under him, were mean perſons and of no account, great only by his favour, and indued with little vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, who ruling as they liſted, and excluding all others, made uſe of his Authority for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage. The Nobility were male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and affected a change in the Government; which might eaſily be brought to paſs by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of King <hi>Edward.</hi> If he would help to raiſe ſome civil broyls and diſſention in the Nation it ſelf, he needed not to be in fear that they could or would trouble his country by any Invaſion: The King hearing the Duke manifeſt what he moſt affected, approving his judgment, promiſed him all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:175204:96"/>
and what he could deſire to accompliſh the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: and he undertaketh by ſome fair way to traffick with the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> for an alteration of the preſent form of Government. After a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intelligence, the Lords of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who under the ſhadow of the Publick good, but really out of their diſdain and particular intereſts, conſpired againſt the King, ſend the Duke word, the golden Age could not be fram'd, nor arms taken for the good of the Commonwealth, nor the State alter'd, without the ſequeſtring of thoſe from the King who miſgovern'd him. And theſe could not be remov'd by that power which was amongſt themſelves, without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and trouble, conſidering the Kings Faction and the Malignant Party. If King <hi>Edward</hi> would agree to the raiſing of an Army in <hi>England</hi> in favour of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and for reſtoring him to his Places and Inheritance, out of which he was moſt unjuſtly ejected: and other pretences, of which they ſhould afford the occaſions; which no way ſhould do harm to the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> diſorder'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and laid waſte, more by the licence of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Peace, than it could have been by War; and at this time beſtow upon them favours, as they might one day hereafter challenge to receive the like; the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be ready with another Army, not to fight, but to ſeize upon the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and miſgovernors of the State: for which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould have many thanks. That this Enterprize could not but prove moſt ſucceſsful, the hatred of the Commons conſidered againſt ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent oppreſſions. The King was fallen into ſo low eſteem, that aſſaulted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he would be conſtrain'd by the ſubmiſſion of his Crown to intreat for ſafety. The King of <hi>England</hi> underſtanding this was to touch the fineſt ſtring of State and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:175204:97"/>
(for it is a matter of much conſequence and main importance, to defend the Subjects of another Prince; for under this Mask and pretence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the Liberties of a People, of aſſiſtance and aid, an Uſurpation and oppreſſion of all Liberty might be hidden; and many have eſtabliſhed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led themſelves in thoſe Kingdoms, which they came to relieve from Tyranny, and the Oppreſſion of their Rulers, keeping by Force what was granted to them at firſt by way of truſt, and under the colour of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſurped a Sovereignty) agreeth eaſily to what was demanded and reſolved upon.</p>
               <p>The Lords of the Aſſociation to play more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly their Game, and mask their intentions (the Commons ever ſuffering and paying for the faults and errors of the great ones) give way for the breaking looſe of the Borderers. Fierce incurſions by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> are made upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the <hi>Scots</hi> upon <hi>England,</hi> ſome Villages on either ſide are burnt. The ſecrecy to this buſineſs, which was inviolably obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, was of great importance, which is the principal knot and tye of great affairs. Rumours are ſpread that the Dukes of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Albany,</hi> with <hi>James</hi> late Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Jerdan</hi> and <hi>Patrick Halyburton,</hi> men proſcrib'd, and upon whoſe heads a price was ſet, were at <hi>Anwick</hi> with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army, and in their march towards <hi>Kelſo.</hi> The King wakned out of his Trances by the Alarms of his Nobility and clamors of the People, made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations to all between ſixty years and ſixteen to meet him at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and to be in readineſs to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their old enemies of <hi>England</hi> now come upon the Borders.</p>
               <p>After many delayes and much loytering, an Army is aſſembled by the Nobility, which conſiſted of Two and twenty thouſand and five hundred; and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:175204:97"/>
a number of Carts charged with ſmall Ordinance. New Incurſions being blazed to have been made by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the King amidſt theſe Troops marched to <hi>Lawder.</hi> The Army was encamped, and all things Ordered the beſt way the occaſion could ſuffer them, little or nothing being left to Fortune, if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould Invade, whom the Lords knew were not at all yet gathered, and though gathered, and in a Body, and upon the Borders, or nearer, would never Invade them.</p>
               <p>The King at this time is marvellouſly perplexed, and become ſuſpicious of the intentions of his Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in this Army, in this confuſion of thoughts, fell upon two extreames. In his demeanor and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation too familiar and inward with his old Domeſtick Servants and Favourites, which rendred them inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (believing the bare Name of King to be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient whilſt weakneſs and ſimplicity had made him deſpiſed, and them hated) and too retired, reſerved and eſtranged from his Nobility, which made them malicious.</p>
               <p>This he did as his penſiveneſs conjectured, that his Nobles ſhould not attempt any thing to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his royal Authority, independant of any Council. But what he moſt feared came to paſs; he reſolved and diſpatched all matters by his Cabinet Counſel: where the Surveyor of his Buildings was better acquainted with the affairs of the State than the graveſt of his Nobility. This prepoſterous courſe of favour made the great men of the Kingdom to fall headlong upon their raſh, though long projected attempt. After many private conferences in their Pavillions, the Chiefs of the Inſurrection, as the Earls of <hi>Anguſs Lennox, Huntley,</hi> the Lords <hi>Gray, Lile</hi> and others, about Midnight come together in the Church of <hi>Lawder</hi> with many Barons and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:175204:98"/>
Here every of them urging the neceſſity of the times, and the dangers the Commonwealth was like to fall into, requireth ſpeedy reſolutions: and having before premeditated, deliberated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded what to follow, they draw up a League and confederation of mutual adherence in this order.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as the King ſuffereth himſelf to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by mean perſons and men of no account, to the contempt of the Nobility, and his beſt Subjects, and to the great loſs of the Commons: The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates conſidering the imminent dangers of the Kingdom, ſhall endeavour to ſeparate the Kings Majeſty from theſe naughty upſtarts, who abuſe his Name and Authority, and deſpiſe of all good men; and have a care that the Commonwealth receive no dammage. And in this quarrel they ſhall all ſtand mutually every one to the defence of another. The deſign agreed upon, and the Confederacy ſworn, the Chiefs of them in Arms enter the Kings Pavillion, where, after they had challenged him of many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in his Government, contrary to his Honour, the Laws and good of his Kingdom, they took Sir <hi>William Roger,</hi> a man from a Muſitian, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a Knight, <hi>James Homill, Robert Cochran,</hi> who of a Surveyor of his works was made Earl of <hi>Mar,</hi> or as ſome mitigate that Title, Intromittor and taker up of the Rents of that Earldom, by whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (ſome Authors have alledged) copper moneys had been coyned, by which a dearth was brought amongſt the Commons; which (as others have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded) was an unjuſt imputation, for that copper money was coined in the Minority of the King, in the time of the Government of the <hi>Boyds,</hi> with others. All theſe being convicted by the clamours of the Army, were immediately hanged upon the Lidder. <hi>John Ramſey</hi> a youth of eighteen years of age, by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:175204:98"/>
the intreaties, prayers, embraces of the King was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Thus they the late objects of envy, were turn'd and become the objects of pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The body of the Commons and the Gentry of the Kingdom by this notorious act at <hi>Lawder,</hi> being engaged, and being made partakers of the Quarrel of the diſcontented Noblemen, and for their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty tyed to ſecond and aſſiſt all their intentions, and to advance their ends; The King is conveyed to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and ſhortly after he either encloſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>Maiden Caſtle</hi> as his Lodging, or which is more probable, was there, by the contrary Faction committed, as his Priſon, the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> and ſome other Lords being appointed to attend him.</p>
               <p>During this time the general humours of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being ripe for miſchief, <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> (every thing falling right as it was plotted) prevailed ſo with King <hi>Edward,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> brother, with the Title of Lieutenant General for him ſet forwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Army conſiſted of Two and twenty thouſand and five hundred. In his retinue went of the Nobility <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> with them was the Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> came not being reſerved for an after-game. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> having been before Commander of <hi>Berwick,</hi> and a Man who was ſtill in his abſence beloved of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, diverted the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> from <hi>Anwick</hi> where he had incamped in <hi>June,</hi> to aſſail the Town of <hi>Berwick.</hi> By his intelligence they enter the Town without great oppoſition, and it is given up to their diſcretion. The Caſtle by the Lord <hi>Hails</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, was made good againſt their aſſaults. The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> fore-ſeeing that this Siege would ſpend much time, conſidering the uncertainty of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:175204:99"/>
events, and being invited to march forward by the Lords of the aſſociation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> committing the charge of aſſailing the Caſtle to the Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> Sir <hi>John Elrington,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parr,</hi> with the body of the Army marched directly to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Country lay open to their Invaſion; no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my taking the Field to oppoſe them, they came in <hi>Scotland</hi> the twentieth day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> One thouſand four hundred eighty two.<note place="margin">1482.</note> The Army encamped at <hi>Reſtlerig,</hi> the Duke himſelf entred the Town of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> which at the intreaty of the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany,</hi> who was his Harbinger, he ſpar'd, receiving ſuch preſents as the Citizens offered unto him. His entry ſeeming rather a Triumph than Hoſtile Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King being ſhut up from him and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured in the Caſtle, the Duke by a publick writing at the Market Places gave out high Demands; That King <hi>James</hi> ſhould perform what he had Covenanted with his Brother King <hi>Edward;</hi> That he ſhould give ſatisfaction for the Damage done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during the laſt Inroads of the Borders, which if he refuſed to accompliſh, he as Lieutenant to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to exact of him and take ſatisfaction of his Country, denouncing him open War, and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all Hoſtility. King <hi>James</hi> forſaken of his People, and wronged by his Lords, laying aſide his Paſſions, and taking to him more moderate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet thoughts, as a Man in Priſon, anſwered nothing to his Demands.</p>
               <p>The Lords, who by their Kings misfortune had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd their felicity, having obtain'd what they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſir'd to obviate the common and laſt danger, the thraldom of their Kingdom by theſe ſtrangers whom they had drawn into the Country for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their liberties, aſſemble themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at <hi>Hadington</hi> with ſome Companies, not to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:175204:99"/>
Fight but to Supplicate. They ſent the Lord <hi>Darn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> and the Elected Biſhop of <hi>Murray</hi> to entreat a ſuſpenſion of Arms, and require a firm and laſting Peace for time to come. The beginning of the War, and taking of Arms was for the ſafety of this the neighbour Country of <hi>England,</hi> miſerably thral'd by a licentious Prince: there was nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a King or Republick, than not to keep their promis'd Faith. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> could have no colour for executing their indignation further upon this Country, which already by the rapine of their own Men was impoveriſh'd and unmanur'd: Only now to be recover'd by entertaining Peace with their Neighbours, and amongſt themſelves. They require that the Marriage contracted between the Prince of <hi>Rotheſay</hi> and Lady <hi>Cicily</hi> King <hi>Edwards</hi> Daughter might be accompliſh'd when it ſhould pleaſe the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the age of the two Princes might ſuffer it. For any ſpoil taken in theſe laſt incurſions, the intereſt conſidered upon both ſides, ſatisfaction ſhould be given out of the publick contributions. The Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> as forgetting and ſeeming not to know the grounds of their coming into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and looking to nothing more than his own Fame and Glory, Anſwer'd, his coming into <hi>Scotland,</hi> was to right the honour of his Country ſo often violated: and to reſtore the Duke of <hi>Albanie,</hi> unjuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Exile, to his own native ſoyl, and the dignity of his Birth: as concerning the Marriage of the Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> with the Daughter of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> He knew not how his Brothers reſolution ſtood at the preſent; whereupon he requir'd repayment of the monys lent to their King upon their firſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and withal a delivery of the Caſtle of <hi>Berwick</hi> up into his hands: or if they could not make the Caſtle to be render'd, they ſhould give their oaths
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:175204:100"/>
upon the holy Evangeliſts that they ſhould neither aſſiſt the Beſieged, or harm the Beſiegers, till the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle were either by Force taken, or upon fair conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons rendred.</p>
               <p>The Lords having received this Anſwer, yielded freely to all the Conditions, except they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perplexed in the rendring of <hi>Berwick:</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Town of old appertaining to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though by force and Violence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had a long time kept it, That did not take away their right and Title. After much conteſting, agreeing to the ſurrender of <hi>Berwick,</hi> they deſired that the Walls of the Town ſhould be demoliſhed, that it might not be a place of Tyranny and Incurſion over their bordering Countries. No arguments could prevail againſt the Duke of <hi>Glouceſters</hi> Reſolutions, and being ſtronger in Power he perſever'd in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and in all likelihood this was agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and the Confederate Lords, and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> before their entring <hi>Scotland.</hi> Thus the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> returned to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the Twenty fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> One thouſand four hundred eighty two; after it had been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Queen <hi>Margarite</hi> to gain Sanctuary for her Husband King <hi>Henry</hi> (when expelled <hi>England</hi>) and remained in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> twenty and one years.</p>
               <p>They likewiſe appointed a day for reſtitution of all the Monys lent by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and promiſed upon a full diſcuſſion to make ſatisfaction for all dammages done the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by any Inroad of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Borders. For the Duke of <hi>Albanies</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, whoſe ſafety was principally pretended in this Expedition, a general Pardon was promiſed for him and all his followers; Together with an aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all diſcontents; whereby he had given unto

him the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> with the Earldoms of <hi>Mar</hi> and <hi>March;</hi> he ſhould be reinveſted in all his former Dignities and Places, and by conſent of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was Proclaimed Lieutenant of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Peace Proclaimed, the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in all ſolemnity of greatneſs returned towards <hi>London,</hi> being welcomed by the King with many demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of great joy. He to ſhow how much he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the conditions of this Peace, went ſolemnly in proceſſion from St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Chappel, now the Parliament Houſe, accompanied with the Queen his Siſter, and a mighty retinue of the greateſt Lords into <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall. Where in preſence of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> and Sir <hi>James Liddale,</hi> Embaſſadors extraordinary from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Peace was Ratified. At the return of the <hi>Scots</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to their Country, King <hi>Edward</hi> ſent an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld with them, who in his Maſters name gave over the Marriage contracted between the Lady <hi>Cicilia</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> and required the money which had been delivered upon hopes of conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his King. The Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> had given their Bond for the redelivery, and a day being granted to them for the Payment, they at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day entirely delivered the ſum. Some thought King <hi>Edward</hi> recalled this Marriage of a ſuſpicion he conceived, that the Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> and the hatred of the Subjects againſt their King amidſt the manifold diſtractions of the Realm, might hazard the Succeſſion of the Prince of <hi>Rothſay</hi> to the Crown. But King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> having gained what he had endeavoured moſt to acquire, a diviſion amongſt the Nobles of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by this a Security from their aſſiſting the <hi>French,</hi> rejected the Match. Beſides the Duke of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:175204:101"/>
                  <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who after his coming in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was laying the Foundations of the Uſurping the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> his Brother once dead, thought the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance of his Brothers Daughter with a King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> too ſtrong a Support to that Race, which he was to declare Baſtard, and a Rock upon which he was confident he ſhould make a fearful ſhipwrack. Neither his Brothers daughter being married to a King of ſuch martial and turbulent Subjects as the people of <hi>Scotland,</hi> durſt he ever attempt the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of her Brothers: and King <hi>Edward</hi> in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this Match committed a greater error of State than he did in his marrying the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Gray,</hi> and forſaking the Lady <hi>Bona</hi> Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the Records of ſome Authors whilſt the King is kept nine Months in the Caſtle of <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> the Lord <hi>Evandale</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, the Earl of <hi>Arguile,</hi> the Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> his Uncle (who for the preſervation of his perſon and honour of his Office accepted the charge to attend him in that Fortreſs) govern'd the State.</p>
               <p>The King (ſay the honeſt Records) had all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which appertained to a Prince, ſave that he could not come abroad, and none was permitted to ſpeak unto him, except in the audience of ſome one of his Lords Keepers; and that his Chamber doors were ſhut before the ſetting of the Sun and long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the riſing opened. Proclamations were Publiſht in his Name and Authority, and other publick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. Such who only heard of him could not but take him to be a free and abſolute Prince, when near he was but a King in phantaſie, and his Throne but

a Picture, the Regal Authority being turned into a Cloak to cover the Paſſions of thoſe who did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> daily importuned by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, Prayers and tears of the Queen (a calm and temperate Lady) for her Husbands Liberty; find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf not ſo reſpected by the other Governours as his Birth and merits did deſerve; being a man who delighted in nothing more than in changes and novations of Court and State: after ſo many ſcorns and rebukes offered to his Brother, and King, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating his long ſufferance, and believing that good turns would make paſt offences be forgotten, and recent benefits were ſufficient to blot away old injuries, with all remembrance of former diſcontents, whilſt the other Governours at <hi>Sterling,</hi> ſecurely paſſed the time, poſted in the Night to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> Here a meeting being appointed of ſome of his Friends and Vaſſals, who knew nothing of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by the aſſiſtance of the Citizens of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> (men entirely loving their King and devoted to him all the time of the Inſurrection of his Nobles) who gave the firſt aſſault, (yet was it rather their intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence than Force) the Caſtle is ſurprized, the King and all his Servants ſet at liberty. This unexpected and noble Act of the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> having ſo fortunate a ſucceſs, brought a mighty change on the Court and State. The King is now again reinſtall'd, and hath this Reſidence in his own Palace, to which many Noblemen and Gentlemen, have frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; rejoycing to ſee ſuch evident tokens of love paſs between the two Brothers, if their affection could have continued. The Provoſt and Baylies of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> in recompence of their Service, were made Sheriffs within all the bounds of their own Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and rewarded with other Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:175204:102"/>
in that Patent, which they call their Golden Charter One thouſand four hundred eighty two. The Lords of the contrary Faction, who remained at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> by this new accident, betook themſelves to new thoughts and conſiderations, every man full of fears and repinings flying to his own dwelling place, and conceiving a great hatred againſt the Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi> They ſaid he was inconſtant, raſh, mad, in ſetting at liberty the man who would prove his Executioner, and one who would never forget any profer'd injury: that if he periſhed before them, it was but his own juſt deſerving and procurement. The Duke contemning thoſe reproaches, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering their calumnies and evil words with patience and good deeds, by the mediation of the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs,</hi> ſtudied a reconciliation between the King and his diſcontented Lords. And his endeavours had ſuch good ſucceſs, that in a ſhort time after this Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſome of them turned ſo familiar and inward with the King, that, like the <hi>Ivy,</hi> they began to ſap the wall by which they had been ſupported. They made the wound of the Kings old jealouſies ranckle again, and added poyſon to former diſcontents; remembring him of the unnaturalneſs of his Brothers firſt Rebellion, and aſſuring him that his ancient Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition had yet more power of him than his new fears of honeſty and reſpect. That howſoever he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed outwardly the arguments of a reconciled Brother, he loved yet to govern, and aimed at the Crown.</p>
               <p>That he had wrought his liberty to bring a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter confuſion in the State than he had ever done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The King, who ever had a watchful eye over his reconciled enemies, and who deſired to be freed and fairly quited of them all, gave way to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies. And they after long deliberation reſolve upon a Plot to bring the Duke within compaſs of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:175204:102"/>
Law: and ſummoned him to anſwer upon Treaſon. And this was the rendring of the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> which they undertook to prove was only by his Intelligence, procuration, and being in company with the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> in that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Though the Duke had an abſolute and general Pardon and an abolition for all was paſt, and the Kings hand at it, they doubted not to null and make it void. All being done by a King conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a powerful Army, and a cloſe Priſoner, which writing could not oblige any private man, far leſs a King: what he then bargained was upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and yielded unto upon hopes of ſaving his life, and an Act exacted by force. The Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany</hi> finding by the Malice and detraction of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Faction, his Brothers countenance altered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and danger the requital of his late ſetting him at liberty, the eſtabliſhed reconciliation being ſhaken by ſuſpicions and fancy of revenge, obeying neceſſity, fled to his Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> out of which he came to <hi>England</hi> to preſent to King <hi>Edward</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> the conſideration of his grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
               <p>In his abſence he is convinced of many points of Treaſon, beſides the being acceſſary to the taking of <hi>Berwick</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> As his dangerous and long intelligence with the King of <hi>England:</hi> his ſending of many Meſſengers at all occaſions unto him. That, without any ſafe conduct or paſs from his Brother, and not ſo much as acquainting him, he had left the Country, come into <hi>England</hi> to deviſe Conſpiracies againſt his King and native Kingdom. The Lord <hi>Creighton</hi> as his friend aſſociate and complice, is forefeited with him, againſt whom Informations were given, That often and divers times, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of hunting ſecretly with the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:175204:103"/>
he rode into <hi>England,</hi> and there meeting with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſent by King <hi>Edward,</hi> he deliberated of matters concerning novations and of the altering the State, That there he kept appointments with <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> the often quench'd fire-brand of his Country. That in ſpight of the Kings Forces ſent their to lie in Garriſon, he kept the Caſtle of <hi>Creighton.</hi> The greateſt diſcontent the King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt him was love to one of his Siſters, and ſome feminine jealouſies. When the Duke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the proceedings againſt himſelf and the Lord <hi>Creighton,</hi> and that for their contumacy and not appearing to anſwer, and give in their anſwer, they were convict of Treaſon, and their Lands to be ſeized upon; He cauſed give up the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> of which he was Lieutenant, to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who immediately placed by Sea a Garriſon in it.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Edward</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> left this World One thouſand four hundred eighty three, and his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> did firſt take the name of Protector and Governour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> and after his Brothers Sons put in the Tower, and their Mother the Queen taking San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, in the Month of <hi>June</hi> poſſeſt himſelf of the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> finding that <hi>Richard</hi> by his change of Fortune had not changed his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, imploreth his Aid in reſtoring him to his own, and repairing not his wrongs alone, but a wrong done in his ſufferings to the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſith there was now an open breach of the Truce and Peace ſo ſolemnly by him ſet down and confirmed by his Brother. If he could be furniſhed but with a few number of choice men of reputation and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to paſs into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and take a tryal of the Minds
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:175204:103"/>
and good will of his Friends and Confederates, he doubted not at his entring the Country to find num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who by his preſence would hazard upon the moſt deſperate dangers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richard</hi> finding the man his Supplicant with whom he endeavoured once an entire friendſhip, and whoſe advancement in Authority he had moſt ſtudied, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeth that five hundred men and Horſes ſhould be choſen upon the borders, with others who were outlaws and neceſſitated ſometime to make incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with <hi>James</hi> the old Earl of <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> a man well known and renowned in the Weſt-borders, ſhould make an in-road into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two and twentieth day of <hi>July,</hi> the baniſhed Champion having choſen a good number of their borderers put forward towards <hi>Loch-Maben</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize a Fair, ſpoil a publick Market, ſeize upon all the Buyers and Sellers, which here meet and Traffick every St. <hi>Magdalens</hi> Feſtival, under pretence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and the liberty of Trading many <hi>Engliſh</hi> had hither reſorted: at the twelfth hour of the day when the Merchants and Country-people were in greateſt ſecurity, the <hi>Burſe</hi> is Invaded and not Bloud but Wares ſought after; the Laird of <hi>Johnſtoun</hi> who was War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and Laird of <hi>Cockpool,</hi> with many ſtout Borderers having Surveyed and Ridden through the places where the People were met, to prevent and hinder all diſorders and dangers, at the noiſe of an Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> diſpatch Poſts to the adjacent bounds for ſupply, and in the mean time rencounter the Plunderers of the Fair. Here is it Fought with greater courage than force, and in a long continued Skirmiſh the danger of the loſs ſtir'd up and incited the parties as much as Fame and Glory.</p>
               <p>The day was near ſpent leaving the advantage to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:175204:104"/>
either ſide diſputable, when the ſupply of freſh men come to defend their Country, and Friends turned the Fortune of the Fight, and put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers all to the rout. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe, and the good attendance of his Servants winneth <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground: but the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> loaden and heavy with years and arms, is taken by <hi>Robert Kirken-patrick</hi> (who for that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice got the lands of <hi>Kirk-michael</hi>) and brought as in triumph to <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> It is Recorded that when the Earl was come in the Kings preſence, he turn'd his back and refus'd to look him in the face, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many outrages he had perpetrated againſt his Father, and this late offence. The King taken with the goodly perſonage, gravity, and great age of the man, commiſerating his long patience and croſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune being in his young days deſigned to be a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, confin'd him as in a free Priſon in the Abacy of <hi>Lyndores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides he conſidered that when occaſion ſerved he might bring him out of this ſolitarineſs, and in theſe turbulent times by his counſel and preſence play more advantageouſly his game of State, being a man of long experience in the affairs of the World, and the moſt learned of all his Nobility. He was now become tyred of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his firſt offence remaining deeply ingraven in his heart, and to counterpoiſe his greatneſs this was the only weight. The Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> found little better entertainment in <hi>England,</hi> the Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, ſome men taken and killed (this being the firſt road upon <hi>Scotland</hi> under the Reign of <hi>Richard,</hi> who had been formerly ſo fortunate in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) his Fame injur'd, and reputation by this dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, the Duke began to be diſliked, and was not received with that kindneſs he was wont, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he earneſtly required out of the bond of Love and friendſhip between them, ſince it was given unto the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Treaſon, and neither ſurpriſed nor taken in lawful War, it might be friendly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Richard</hi> dall'yd with him, and paſs'd away that purpoſe with complemental Letters all the time of his Government, which was not long; for the year One thouſand four hundred eighty ſix. <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> came with ſome Companies out of <hi>France</hi> (of which that famous Warriour <hi>Bernard Stuart</hi> Lord <hi>Aubany,</hi> Brother to the Lord <hi>Darnley</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> had the Leading) which by the reſort of his Country men turned into an Army, and rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred <hi>Richard</hi> at <hi>Boſworth</hi> where he was killed, and <hi>Henry</hi>-Proclaimed King of <hi>England:</hi> To which Victory it was uncertain whether Vertue or Fortune did more contribute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> before this diſaſter of <hi>Richard,</hi> at a Tilting with <hi>Louys</hi> Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> by a ſplint of a Spear in his head had received his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wound, One thouſand four hundred eighty three: He was a man of great courage, an enemy to Reſt and Peace, delighting in conſtant changes and novations.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:175204:106"/>
He left behind two Sons, <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his ſecond Marriage upon the Earl of <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loignes</hi> Daughter, who was Tutor to King <hi>James</hi> the Fifth and Governour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> born of the Earl of <hi>Orkenays</hi> Daughter his firſt Wife, Biſhop of <hi>Murray,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Skroon.</hi> Into which places he was intruded, to make the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his other Brother more peaceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margarite</hi> the Queen about theſe times, a good and vertuous Lady, died One thouſand four hundred eighty ſix, and was buried at <hi>Cambuskennel</hi> the Twenty ninth of <hi>February.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The overthrow and death of <hi>Richard</hi> being known abroad, King <hi>James</hi> taking the advantage of the time, beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar.</hi> The Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd Souldiers finding no relief nor aſſiſtance from their Country, and aſcertained of the change of their Maſter, rendered up the Fort to the hands of the <hi>Scots;</hi> it was of no great importance to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and only ſerved to be a fair bridge of Treaſon for <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Rebels, and a Cittadel of Conſpiracies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> after his Victory and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, ſent <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Edgecomb</hi> Embaſſadours to King <hi>James,</hi> for renewing the Truce, and if it were poſſible, to agree upon a Stable and laſting Peace between the Realms. King <hi>James</hi> taking a promiſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy of the Embaſſadours, that what he imparted to them, ſhould not be laid open to his Nobility, told, <hi>He earneſtly affected a Peace with all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but above all others with their King, as much for this own valour, as for the honour and intereſts of the two Kingdoms: But he knew his People ſo ſtubborn and oppoſite to all his deſigns, that if they underſtood his mind and reſolutions, they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to croſs his intentions; wherefore publickly
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:175204:107"/>
he could only condeſcend to ſeven years Truce, a long Peace being hardly obtained from men brought up in the free licence of War, who diſdained to be reſtrained within the Narrow limits of Laws. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſhould undertake for him to King</hi> Henry, <hi>in the Word of a Prince, that this Truce before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring of it ſhould be renewed, and with all ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities again confirmed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Embaſſadours reſpecting his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their King, accepted the conditions. Thus was there a Truce or Peace covenanted and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſeven years to come between the two Realms.</p>
               <p>After ſo many back-blows of Fortune and ſuch canvaſſing, the King enjoying a Peace with all his Neighbours abroad, became exceeding religious; the miſeries of Life drawing the mind to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of what ſhall be after it. During his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he was wont to come in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Abby of <hi>Holy-rood houſe</hi> to the Churches in the High-Town every Wedneſday and Friday. By which Devotion he became beloved of his People: Nothing more winning their hearts than the opinion they have of the Sanctity of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And that he did not this for the Faſhion nor Hypocriſie, the application of his wit and power to the Adminiſtration of ſtrict juſtice did prove; for he began to ſuppreſs the inſolencies of ſtrong Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, defend and maintain the Rights of the Poor, againſt Tyrants and abuſers of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. He ſitteth himſelf in Council daily, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth affairs of moſt weight in his own perſon.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>October</hi> following the Peace with <hi>England,</hi> One thouſand four hundred eighty ſeven a Parliament was called, in which many Acts were made againſt Oppreſſours. Juſtices were appointed to paſs through the whole Kingdom, and ſee male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:175204:107"/>
deſervedly puniſhed. Acts were made that no convention of friends ſhould be ſuffered for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying and defence of criminal Perſons: But that every one Attainted ſhould appear at the moſt with ſix Proctors; that, if found guilty, they ſhould not be reft from Juſtice by ſtrong hand. Such of the Nobility who feared and conſequently hated him, finding how he had acquired the love of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by his Piety in the obſervance of Religion, and his ſeverity in executing Juſtice, were driven unto new Meditations. They began to ſuſpect he would one day free himſelf from theſe turbulent Spirits who could not ſuffer him to enjoy a Peace, nor Reign. He had advanced at this time to Offices of State and Places men whoſe Fortunes did wholly depend upon his ſafety and well-fare: at which ſome Noblemen whoſe Ambition was to be in publick charge and of the Counſel, pretending to that out of right, which was only due unto them by favour, did highly ſtorm and look upon thoſe others with envious eyes. The King thus falling again into his old ſickneſs, they bethought them how to renew their old remedy. They were alſo jealous of the remembrance of the dis-ſervice they had done him, and that he would never forget old quarrels; They were prepared and ready to make a Revolution of the State, but had not yet found their Center to begin motion, nor a ground for Rebellion. All this while there was not matter enough for an Inſurrection, nor to diſpoſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Hearts to a Mutiny.</p>
               <p>The King delighted with his Buildings of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and the amenity of the Place, for he had raiſed there a fair and ſpacious Hall, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Colledge for Divine Service, which he named the Chappel Royal: and beginning to be poſſeſt and taken up with the Religion of theſe times, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:175204:108"/>
to endow this Foundation with conſtant Rents, and ample Revenues, and make this Rock the choyce Sanctuary of his Devotions. The Priory of <hi>Coldingham,</hi> then vacant and fallen in his hands, he annexed the ſame to his Chappel Royal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured an Act of Parliament, That none of the Lieges ſhould attempt to do contrary to this Union and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexation, or to make any Impetration thereof at the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> under the pain of Treaſon. The Priors of this Convent having been many years of the Name of <hi>Hume,</hi> it was by the Gentlemen of that Name ſurmis'd, that they ſhould be intereſted and wronged in their Eſtates, by reaſon of the Tithes and other Caſualties appertaining to this Benefice, if a Prior of any other Sirname were promoted to this Place. The King being often Petitioned and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored that he ſhould not alter the accuſtomed form of the Election of that Prior, nor remove it from their Name, nor ſuffer the Revenues to be otherways beſtowed than they were wont to be of old; and he continuing in his reſolution of annexing them to his Chappel: after long pawſing and deliberation amongſt themſelves, as men ſtirred up by the Male-contents and a proud Faction; fit for any the moſt dangerous enterpriſe, they proceed upon ſtronger Grounds to over-turn his intentions and divert his purpoſe. The Lord <hi>Hailles,</hi> and others of the Sirname of <hi>Hepburn,</hi> had been their conſtant Friends, Allies and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; with them they enter in a combination, that they ſhould mutually ſtand to the defence of others, and not ſuffer any Prior to be received for <hi>Colding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> if he were not of one of their two Sirnames. This Covenant is firſt privately by ſome mean Gentlemen ſworn, who after draw on their Chiefs to be of the Party. Of how ſmall beginnings doth a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief ariſe! the Male-contented Lords knowing thoſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:175204:108"/>
two Sirnames to be numerous, active and powerful in thoſe parts of the Country where they remain'd, lay hold upon this Overture, and beginning from their particulars they make the cauſe to be general. They ſpread Rumours abroad that the King was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come terrible and not to be truſted; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Proteſtations and Outward demeanour, that he yet meditated Revenge, and had begun to invade and ſhake the ancient Priviledges of the <hi>Humes,</hi> more out of ſpight and diſcontent againſt them for having aſſiſted and follow'd the Lords of the Reformation of the State, than any intention of the increaſing the Rents of his new erected Chappel. That ere long he would be avenged upon all whom he either knew were acceſſary, or ſuſpected to have been upon the Plot of <hi>Lawder</hi> Bridge, or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> That it was ſometime better to commit a fault unpardonable, than venture under the Pardon. That the King had taken a Reſolution to live upon the Peoples contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and give his own Revenues to particular Men. The faults of his Counſellours are highly exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They are baſe Perſons, and he himſelf given to diſſimulation, miſdevotion and revenge; as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerved he would remember old wrongs: It was good to obey a King but not to lay the head upon a Block to him, if a Man could ſave himſelf.</p>
               <p>After long ſmother of diſcontent and hatred of the Nobility and People, Rankor breaking daily forth into Seditions and alterations, The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Haylles</hi> being the Ring-Leaders, many Noblemen and Gentlemen under fained pretences, eſpecially the courſes of ſwift Horſes, keep frequent meetings. Where they renew their Covenant agreed upon at <hi>Lawder</hi> Church, the neceſſity of the times, and the danger of the Commonwealth requiring it, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:175204:109"/>
gave their Oaths, that at what time ſoever the King ſhould challenge them directly or indirectly, or wrong them in their Rights, Poſſeſſions, Places, Perſons, They ſhould abide together as if they were all one Body, marry each others quarrels, and the wrongs done to any one of them ſhould be done to them all.</p>
               <p>When the King underſtood the Confederacy of the Lords, to anticipate the danger, he made choice of a Guard for the preſervation of his Perſon and Servants, Of which he made <hi>John Ramſay</hi> of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne,</hi> a Man whom he had preſerved at <hi>Lawder</hi> and advanced to be Maſter of his Houſhold at Court, Captain: giving him a Warrant not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Man in Arms approach the Court by ſome miles. This in ſtead of cooling, exaſperated the Choler of the Male-contents, and ſtirr'd them to aſſemble with numerous Retinues all in Arms. The King ſcarce believing the Minds of ſo many were corrupted, and perſuading himſelf, the Authority of a King would ſupply the want of ſome Power, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd certain of them upon fourty days to anſwer according to Law.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe ſome rent, his Summons, and beat ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully his Heraulds and Meſſengers for diſcharging their Offices: Others appeared, but with numbers of their Adherents, Friends, Allies and Vaſſals: And here he found that the faults of great Delinquents are not without great danger taken notice of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended; he uſed ſome Stratagems to ſurpriſe the Heads and Chiefs of their Faction: But unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giving truſt to the promiſes of thoſe who lent their ears, but not their hearts to his words, his Deſigns were diſcovered before they produced any effects; his ſecrets all laid open to his great hatred and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the Diſcoverers taking themſelves to the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:175204:109"/>
factious Rebels, and cheriſhing unkind thoughts in all whom they ſaw diſtaſted with his Government; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf betrayed and his intentions divulged, he remained in great doubt to whom he ſhould give credit. The nature and manner of all things changed by the League of the Confederates, he thought it high time to remove a little further from that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent which might have overwhelmed him, and made them Maſters of his Perſon. To temporize and win time, cauſed furniſh the Caſtles of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Sterling</hi> with proviſion of Victual, Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Garriſons to defend them from the dangers of War; he reſolved to make his abode beyond the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> and to leave the South Parts of the Kingdom. After which deliberation he entred a Ship of Sir <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> a famous Navigator and ſtout Commander at Sea) which pretended to make ſail for the low-Countries, and was lying at Anchor in the <hi>Forth.</hi> Theſe who ſaw him aboard, ſpread a rumour that he was flying to <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Lords of the Inſurrection making uſe of this falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſeized on his carriage in the Paſſages towards the North, rifled his Coffers, ſpoiled his Servants of their ſtuff and baggage. And then after certainty that he was but Landed in <hi>Fyfe,</hi> and from that was in Progreſs to the Northern parts, preparing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his good Subjects to be in readineſs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him at his return, they ſurprized the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar.</hi> The monys found in his Coffers wage Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers againſt him, and the Harneſs and Weapons of his Magazines arm them, Having gathered ſome companies together, tumultuouſly they overrun the Countries upon the South of the <hi>Forth,</hi> rifling and plundering all men who went not with them, or whom they ſuſpected not to favour their deſperate and ſeditious ends. In his progreſs the King held
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:175204:110"/>
Juſtice Courts at <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Innereſs,</hi> where <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> Lord <hi>Creighton,</hi> not long before impeacht with the Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and was received in favour and pardoned: after which grace he ſhortly left this World. Whilſt the King in the North, the Lords in the South are making their Preparations; When they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at <hi>Lithgow</hi> they find themſelves many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and ſtrong in Power; the ſucceſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings being above their hopes: there only wanted a man eminently in eſteem with the People, and noble of Birth, to give luſtre to their Actions, ſhadow their Rebellion, and be the titular and painted head of their Arms. When they had long deliberated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this great Man, they aſſented all that there was none to be Parrallel'd to the Prince of <hi>Rothſay</hi> the Kings own Son. So ſtrongly Providence befools all human Wiſdom and fore-ſight; his Keepers being corrupted by Gifts, Penſions and promiſes of divers Rewards, he is delivered into their hands: and by Threats, That they would otherwiſe give up the Kingdom to the King of <hi>England,</hi> he is conſtrained to go with them. To heighten the hatred againſt the King, and the cloſlier to deceive the People (for the love of Subjects is ſuch towards their natural Kings, that except they be firſt deceived by ſome pretences and notable ſophiſm, they will not ariſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in Arms and Rebel) they make Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and by their Deputies by way of Remonſtrances ſpread abroad Seditious Papers, in what a Sea of blood would theſe men launch into? that all true Subjects ſhould come in defence of the Prince, and take Arms; becauſe his Fathers jealouſies and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious fears were riſen to that height, that nothing but his Sons Death or Impriſonment could temperate them. That he was raiſing an Army to take his Son
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:175204:110"/>
out of their hands, that he might do with him as he had done with his own Brothers. That Force was the only means to work his ſafety and keep the Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this miſchief within bounds, they alſo ſhould take Arms to reduce the Government to a better form, for that the Kingdom was oppreſſed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable grievances: the King being altogether given to follow the advice, projects and counſels of baſe men; to amaſs and gather great ſums of mony from his People, upon which he ſtudied to maintain his Court and State, and give away his own.</p>
               <p>When the Engine was prepared for the People, and ſpread abroad, they ſent to the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> then cloſely as a Monk ſhut up in the Abby of <hi>Lyndores,</hi> to come out, be of the Party, and aſſiſt them with his Counſel and Friends, promiſing if their attempt had happy Succeſs, to reſtore him again to his ancient Poſſeſſions and Heritage, former Dignities, and the Places of Honour of his Anceſtors. The Earl, whom time and long experience had made wary and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, having a ſuſpicion the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> who poſſeſſed the greateſt part of his eſtate, had been the chief motioner of this liberty: and that rather to try what he would do, than that he minded really to ſet him free, refuſed to come out of his Cloiſter. And by his Letters diſſuaded them from their bold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize againſt their Prince; wiſhing they would ſet his houſe and himſelf for a pattern and Preſident of Rebellion. He ſent to all ſuch of his Friends whom his diſaſters had left unruined, to take arms for the King, as the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> of <hi>Kayvers</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The King neither loſing courage nor councel for the greatneſs of the danger of the Rebellion, truſting much to his good fortune, with ſuch Forces as came with him from the North, in Captain <hi>Woods</hi> Ships and other Boats and Veſſels prepared to that end,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:175204:111"/>
paſſeth the <hi>Forth</hi> near the <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> an old Fortreſs and Sea-port in <hi>Weſt Lothian,</hi> not far from the Caſtle of <hi>Abercorn,</hi> and that place where the forces of the Earl of <hi>Dowglaſs</hi> left him, and the King his Father ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo harmleſs a Victory. Before the arrival of the King at this Place, the Earls of <hi>Montroſs, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn</hi> Lords <hi>Maxwel</hi> and <hi>Ruthven</hi> with others, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by Letters of the Rendevouz, hand come to the place, had encamped, and were attending him. And he muſtered a ſufficient Army to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Lords of the aſſociation, who from all quarters were aſſembled, having with them the Prince to add Authority to their quarrel. The two Armies being in readineſs to decide their indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by a Battle, the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> the Kings Uncle ſo travailed between the Lords of either Party and the King, that a ſuſpenſion of Arms was agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reconcilement: and the Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf a pledge for the accompliſhing of the Kings part of the reconcilement, to the Lord <hi>Haylles,</hi> and was ſent to be kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was not a ſmall fault of this Prince: the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Forces were not at this time equal to his, neither had they eſſayed to hinder the Landing of his Army, being but in gathering; the Caſtle of <hi>Blackneſs</hi> was for his defence, and his Ships traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up and down the <hi>Forth,</hi> in caſe of neceſſity for ſuccour. That if he had hazarded a Battle, he had been near to have recovered all that reputation he had before loſt. Now upon either ſide ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers are disbanded, ſome Gentlemen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to return to their own dwelling places. The King in a peaceable manner retireth to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Athol</hi> was now removed from him, and many of the other Lords who loved him returned to their houſes; the Counſel of Man
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:175204:111"/>
not being able to reſiſt the determinations of God. The Lords ſuſpecting ſtill the King to be implacable in their behalf and unacceptable in his Caſtle, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prince always with them, entring upon new Meditations hold ſundry meetings how to have his Perſon in their Power, and make him a Prey to their Ambitious deſigns. The Town of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with Troups of Armed Men, the Villages about repleniſhed with Souldiers. The King warned of his danger, fortifies of new the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> for his defence, and is brought to ſuch a tameneſs, that reſolving to do that with love of every Man, which he feared in end he ſhould be conſtrained unto with the univerſal hatred of all, and his own damage and danger, out of a paſſive Fortitude ſent Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, indifferent Noblemen, to the Lords and his Son to underſtand their intentions and what they meant. Why his Son was kept from him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the head of their Faction. Why his Uncle was ſo cloſely impriſon'd, and himſelf as it were, blocked up by their tumultuous meetings in Arms? He was content they ſhould have an abolition of all that was paſt, that their puniſhments ſhould not be infinitely extended, and that they ſhould think upon a general agreement after the beſt and fitteſt manner they could deviſe, and ſet it down. They finding their offences flew higher than hope of Pardon could aſcend unto. Their ſuſpitions, and the conſcience of their crime committed, breeding ſuch a diſtruſt out of an apprehenſion of fear, anſwered, that they found no true meaning. Open War was to be preferred to a peace full of deceit, danger, and fears, that being aſſured he would weave out his begun projects againſt them, they could not think of any ſafety, nor have aſſurance of their lives nor fortunes, unleſs he freely reſigned the Title of his Crown and Realm in favour
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:175204:112"/>
of his Son, and voluntarily depoſe himſelf, leaving the Government of the People and Kingdom to the Lords of his Parliament, diveſting himſelf wholly of his Royal dignity. Neither would they come to any ſubmiſſion or capitulation, until he conſented to this main point and granted it ſubmiſſively.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> notwithſtanding of this anſwer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a clear proſpect of the inconveniences and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which were growing, and the many injuries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, and affronts put upon him, yet really affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Peace, ſought unto <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo to the <hi>Pope</hi> and King of <hi>France</hi> to make an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement between him and his Subjects. The Kings accordingly interpoſed their Mediation in a round and Princely manner, not only by way of requeſt and perſuaſion; but alſo by way of Proteſtation and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, declaring that they thought it to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of all Kings, if Subjects ſhould be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give Laws unto their Soveraign; a Legitimate King, though a Tyrant, was not ſubordinate to the Authority of <hi>Subjects. James</hi> was not a Tyrant; his errours proceeding moſt part from youth and evil counſel. That ſuppoſe the King had done them wrong, it was not wiſely done, for a deſire of revenge, to endanger their particular Eſtates, and the peace and ſtanding of the whole Kingdom. What State was there ever ſo pure, but ſome corruption might creep into it? That they ſhould be very cautious how they ſhook the Frame of <hi>Monarchical</hi> Government too far; That they would accordingly reſent and Revenge it. Rage prevailing againſt Reaſon and fears, the Lords made that ſame anſwer to theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours which they had ſent to the King himſelf before. As for the <hi>Popes</hi> Embaſſie which was ſent by <hi>Adrian de Caſtello,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Legate was coming, and the Lords fearing the danger of it, for in thoſe
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:175204:112"/>
times it might have drawn the moſt part of all the Towns, and the Commons, for fear of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, to have adhered to the King, or ſtood in an indifferency, made all poſſible haſte before it ſhould have been delivered, to make Head againſt their Soveraign, and decide their Quarrel in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; <hi>Urban</hi> the Fourth Armed <hi>Henry</hi> the Third King of <hi>England</hi> againſt all thoſe that would not return to their due and old obedience to him, and all his diſloyal Subjects.</p>
               <p>The King was in a ſtrong <hi>Fort,</hi> and if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill there, matters in a little time had faln forth more to his wiſhes; and his Enemies might have been brought to a ſubmiſſion: for his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the North, as the <hi>Forbeſſes, Oguilbuyes,</hi> the <hi>Graunts, Frazeres, Meldrums,</hi> many of the <hi>Gordounes, Keethes,</hi> and others who adhered to him out of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and duty, were advancing towards him. But whether miſinformed or betrayed by ſome of his own, who made him believe, that unleſs he could command the Country about <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the Caſtle was of no ſuch importance as was the Caſtle of <hi>Sterlin</hi> for him, in conſideration of the paſſage over the River of <hi>Forth</hi> at a Bridge for thoſe were coming to his Aid: The Lords of the Aſſociation counterfeiting a Retreat and diſperſing themſelves in the Country, that they might draw him from that Hold, he raſhly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly iſſued out of the Caſtle and left his beloved Town of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Montroſs, Glen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn,</hi> Lords <hi>Maxwel</hi> and <hi>Ruthen</hi> accompanied him to the <hi>Blackneſs;</hi> his Forces here encreaſing he marched towards <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Rendevous and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Place of meeting for all his Loyal Subjects, there he diſplayed his Royal Standard. Here the perfidious Conſtable (an unparralleld example of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude) who had betrayed the Son, in an Hoſtile
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:175204:113"/>
manner kept the Father out of his own Caſtle, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons mounted, Piſtols cockt, and level'd at him, and expoſed him a prey to his Rebels, In the amazement and deliberation what to go about, being thus ſhut out of his Caſtle, Tidings came to him, That the Confederates were come near to <hi>Falkirk,</hi> a little Town ſix miles Eaſtward from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould not be diſcouraged by this unexpected accident, truſting to his right and preſent Power; being more ſtout than prudent, he reſolveth to ſet all upon the hazard of a Battle. The Confederates had paſſed the <hi>Carron,</hi> a River under the <hi>Falkirk,</hi> and were encamped above the Bridge near the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood:</hi> The King ſet forwards with his Army upon the otherſide of the <hi>Torwood,</hi> near a ſmall brook named <hi>Sawchy-Burn.</hi> This field is a Plain not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from that <hi>Bannoch-burn,</hi> where King <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Bruce</hi> overthrew the great Army of <hi>Edward Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi> Here both Armies advance forward in Battel ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray.</p>
               <p>The Lords rang'd their Hoſt in three Squadrons; the Vanguard was led by the Lords <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Hailles</hi> and their friends conſiſting of Eaſt <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>March-men;</hi> The middle ward was compoſed of the <hi>Liddeſdale, Annandale, Eweſdale, Tiviotdale, Tweddale, Galloway-men:</hi> the main Battle was of Weſt <hi>Lothian-men,</hi> where moſt of the Lords were, and amongſt whom the Prince was kept. In the Kings Army the Earl of <hi>Monteeth,</hi> Lords <hi>Aresken, Graham, Ruthen, Maxwel</hi> commanded the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. The left wing which conſiſted of Weſtland and Highland men, was committed to the Earl of <hi>Glencarn.</hi> The Lords <hi>Boyd, Lyndeſay</hi> the Earl of <hi>Crawford</hi> commanded in the Rear or great Battel, amongſt whom was the King armed from head to foot upon a great Courſier, eaſie to be known and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:175204:113"/>
diſcern'd from the reſt. The firſt Charge is valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given and Launce meeting with Launce, the Vanguard of the Lords began to yield ground, and was ſtrongly repulſed. But the next Charge being given by <hi>Annandale</hi> Men and the ranck Riders of the Borders, The middle ward of the Kings Army is beaten back to the main Battle; Notwithſtanding of which it is Fought a while with marvellous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and great hardineſs and aſſurance, until the Standard Royal was beaten down, and thoſe who defended it were ſlain, the violence of the bickering being moſtly where it was planted. The Kings Army now beginning to bow, not being ſufficient to reſiſt the numbers of freſh Aſſailers, the Horſe-men obeying no direction, turned their backs. In this rowt and confuſion of Horſe and Foot-men, the King ſeeking to retire towards the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> where not far off ſome Boats and the Ships of Sir <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Wood</hi> attended the fortune of Battel, by the fall of his Horſe, in leaping a Ditch, being ſore bruiſed, was carried by ſuch who knew him not, to a Mill at <hi>Bannoch-Burn.</hi> The day was now the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and wrong had prevailed againſt Right, when the Prince of <hi>Rothſay</hi> amazed at the noiſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the flying and following Souldiers, and in ſuſpition of the worſt, gave out expreſs and ſtrait Commandment with threatnings to the Diſobeyers, that none ſhould preſume to purſue his Father, nor others in the Chaſe. Notwithſtanding which, he was followed and killed in a Mill in cold Blood. Theſe who followed him were the Lord <hi>Gray, Robert Sterling</hi> of <hi>Keer,</hi> Sir <hi>Andrew Borthick</hi> a Prieſt, whom Fame reporteth after ſhiriving to have ſtobb'd him with a Dagger.</p>
               <p>The Enſigns taken, the Army diſſipated and put to flight, the Baggage rifled, the Death of the King
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:175204:114"/>
being rumoured through the Armies, the Victors turned ſlow in the chaſe, and gave field-room to all that would fly, no ſeverity being uſed againſt any found unarm'd; for the Lords of the Aſſociation purſu'd the King not the People. The diſcomfited fled towards <hi>Sterlin;</hi> the victorious retir'd to their Camp, and the next morning to <hi>Linlithgow.</hi> On the Kings ſide <hi>Alexander Cunningham</hi> Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> was ſlain, and as ſome have Recorded, the Lords <hi>Ares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, Simple, Ruthven, John Ramſey</hi> of <hi>Balmayn</hi> cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> and his chief favourite, with their friends and Vaſſals: the Laird of <hi>Inneys, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Scot</hi> Director of the Chancery, with ſome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemens Friends and Vaſſals: many were hurt who recovered of their wounds, and this Battle ſeem'd rather a brave encounter and meeting of Launces in ſome Liſts, than a Field of great deeds of Arms, and the Victory was obtained rather by diſorder, and the raſhneſs of the Vanquiſhed than by the Valour of the Victorious. This Battle was Fought the year One thouſand four hundred eighty eight, the Eleventh day of <hi>June,</hi> which is the Feſtival of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the Twenty ninth year of the Reign, and thirty five of the Age of this King. He had iſſue <hi>James</hi> the Fourth who ſucceeded, <hi>Alexander</hi> Arch-biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Marr:</hi> The Conſpirators with all funeral Rites and Royal Pomp, as in expiation of the wrongs they had done him living, near his Queen in the Abby Church of <hi>Cambuskynneth,</hi> buried his body.</p>
               <p>This King concerning his perſonage was of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture higher than ordinary, well proportioned, his hair was black, his viſage was rather long than round, approaching in colour more to thoſe in the Southern than Northern Climates. Concerning his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, He was a Prince of an haughty and towring
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:175204:114"/>
Spirit, loved to govern alone, affecting an abſolute Power and Royal Perogative over his People. He knew that Noblemen were of his Predeceſſours mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the coyn, and why he might not put his ſtamp upon the ſame mettal, or when theſe old Medals were defaced, that he might not refound them and give them a new Print, he thought no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could be given. His Reign ſeemeth a Theater ſpread over with mourning and ſtain'd with Blood, where in a Revolution many Tragedies were acted. Neither were the neighbour Kingdoms about in a calmer eſtate during his Reign. <hi>France</hi> under <hi>Louys</hi> the Eleventh, <hi>England</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Uſurper, <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> under <hi>Charles</hi> the War-like; <hi>Arnold</hi> Duke of <hi>Guilders</hi> was impriſoned by his own Son.</p>
               <p>As if the heavenly Influences were ſometimes all together ſet to produce upon this Ball of the Earth nothing but Conſpiracies, Treaſons, Troubles, and for the wickedneſs of the Inhabitants to deprive them of all reſt, and contentment.</p>
               <p>This King is by the moſt condemned, as a raſh, imprudent dangerous Prince: good People make good Kings; when a People run directly to oppoſe the Authority of their Soveraign, and aſſume Rebellion and arrogancy for obedience, reſiſting his faireſt motions and moſt profitable commandments, if a King be Martial, in a ſhort time they are beaten and brought under. If he be politick, prudent and foreſeeing in a longer time (as wild Dear) they are ſurprized and either brought back to their firſt order and condition, or thrall'd to greater miſeries. If he be weak and ſuffer in his Reputation or State or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by them, the Prince who ſucceedeth is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Revenger of his wrongs. And all Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Subjects if they proſper not in a high degree,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:175204:115"/>
advance the Soveraignty: This Prince ſeemeth not to have been naturally evil inclined, but to have been conſtrained to leave his natural inclination and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate to run upon Precipices and dangers: his tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Subjects never ſuffering him to have reſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes who in the beginning of their Reigns have been admired for their fair Actions, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of their Subjects, have turn'd from one extremity to another, and become their rebellious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects executioners. He was provoked to do many things by the inſolency of private men: and what ſome call Tyranny and fierceneſs in a Prince, is but juſt ſeverity. He ſought to be feared, believing it to be the only way to obedience. It is true, injuries took ſuch deep impreſſion in his mind, that no after ſervice could blot them away. The taking away of his Favourites, made him ſtudy revenge, which if he had not done, he had to much of the <hi>Stoical</hi> vertues, little of the <hi>Heroical</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe who blame Princes, under a pure and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchy for having Favourites, would have them inhumane, baſe and contemptible, and would deprive them of Power to confer favours according to the diſtinguiſhing power of their underſtanding and conceptions. The choice a Prince maketh of men whom he advanceth to great imployments, is not ſubject to any mans cenſure. And were it bad, yet ought it to be paſs'd over, if not approv'd; leaſt the diſcretion and judgment of the Prince be queſtioned, and his Reputation wounded; Favourites are ſhrines to ſhaddow Princes from their People. Why ſhould a people not allow a Prince ſome to whom he may unmask himſelf, and diſcover the ſecrets of his Heart? If his ſecrets ſhould be imparted to many, they would be no longer ſecrets? Why ſhould it be impoſed on a Prince to love all his Subjects alike, ſince he is not
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:175204:115"/>
beloved of them all alike? This is a deſire to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over the affections of Princes, whom men ſhould reverence.</p>
               <p>He ſeemeth too much to have delighted in retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to have been a hater of buſineſs; nor that he troubled himſelf with any but for formalities ſake, more deſirous of quietneſs than Honour. This was the fault of the Governours of his youth, who put him off buſineſs of State, that they might the more eaſily reach their own ends, and by making him their ſhadow, govern after their pleaſure; Of this delight in ſolitarineſs his Brothers took their advantage and wan the people to their obſervance.</p>
               <p>He was much given to Buildings and trimming up of Chappels, Halls, and Gardens, as uſually are the lovers of Idleneſs: and the rareſt frames of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Pallaces in <hi>Scotland</hi> were moſtly raiſed about his time. An humour which though it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable in men which have not much to do, yet it is harmful in Princes; As to be taken with admiration of Watches, Clocks, Dyals, Automates, Pictures, Statues. For the Art of Princes is to give Laws and govern their people with wiſdom in peace, and glory in war; to ſpare the humble and proſtrate the proud.</p>
               <p>He is blam'd of Avarice, yet there is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Recorded of it, ſave the encroaching upon the dealing, and taking the giving to whom he pleaſed, of Church Benefices; which if he had liv'd in our times, would have been held a vertue. He was of a credulous Diſpoſition, and therefore eaſie to be abuſed, which hath moved ſome to Record he was given to Divination and to inquire of future accidents: which if it be credible was the fault of thoſe times. <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth of <hi>England</hi> is ſaid to have had that ſame fault, and that by the miſinterpretation of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of a Necromancer, which foretold that one,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:175204:116"/>
the firſt Letter of whoſe name was <hi>G.</hi> ſhould Uſurp the Kingdom, and diſpoſſeſs the Children of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he took away his Brother <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence;</hi> which being really practiſed in <hi>England,</hi> ſome <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Writers (that a King of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould not be inferiour, to any of his Neighbour Princes in wickedneſs) without grounds have recorded the ſame to have been done by this King, his love was great to learned men, he uſed as Counſellors in his important affairs <hi>John Ireland</hi> a Doctour of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and one of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> made Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Blackadore,</hi> whom he promoted to be Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> Mr. <hi>William Elphinſtoun,</hi> whom of an Official or Commiſſary of <hi>Lothian,</hi> he ſurrogated in the place of Mr. <hi>Robert Blackadore,</hi> and made Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> and his faults either in Religion or Policy may be attributed to theſe and his other Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
               <p>Many have thought that the fatal Chariot of his Precipice was, that he had equally offended Kindred, Clergy, Nobility and People. But ſuppoſe this had been true, why ſhould ſuch an horrible miſchief have been deviſed, as to arm his own Son againſt him? and that neither the fear of Divine Juſtice, the reſpect of Infamy with the preſent or after times, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the example, had power to divert the minds of men from ſuch a cruel Deſign! This was really to ſeeth the Kid in the Mothers milk, and to make an innocent youth obnoxious to the moſt hainous Crime that could be committed. Whatever cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains could be ſpread to overſhadow and cover this miſchief, the horrour of this Fact poſſeſt this Prince to his laſt hour, and God out of his Juſtice exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the revenge of his cruelty upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:175204:116"/>
Commons, and the Prince himſelf at the field of <hi>Flowden:</hi> where ſome of the chief Actors of this Paricide were in their own perſons, others in the perſons of their Succeſſors, ſacrificed to the Ghoſt of this King.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY Of the LIFE and Reign of James the Fourth, KING of SCOTLAND.</head>
               <p>THe Lords who had choſen rather to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted famous Rebels than contemn'd Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by their boldneſs of enterprizing, skill of managing the Publick affairs, and continued purchaſes, ſwelling to that greatneſs of Power, that they found none to counterpoiſe few to oppoſe to their Deſigns; to make their Rebellion lawful, and ſhow the World they intended not the Subverſion of their Country, but of their opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive King, nor that they did diſlike Soveraignity, ſo they might have a Prince who would be ruled by their directions, take the name, and leave to them the Majeſty and Authority of his place: after the killing of the Father, call a Parliament for the inſtalling of the Son in the Royal Throne; few of the three Eſtates here meeting, except themſelves and the Commiſſioners of Burroughs, in the Month of <hi>June</hi> the year One thouſand four hundred eighty eight
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:175204:119"/>
at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> the Prince is Crowned, then having not attained the ſixteenth year of his age. Though theſe men had aſſumed the Government, yet in divers parts of the Country they had but doubtful obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor was their Authority univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, the flames of diſſention ſeeming yet neither to be extinguiſhed, nor altogether ſmothered with the Life of the late King. On the Sea Sir <hi>Andrew Wood,</hi> who had attended the event of the laſt Battle, maintained reſolutely the Quarrel of his dead Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Five tall Ships ſent by the King of <hi>England</hi> to his Confederates aid (but which came too late) pretending a revenge upon his diſloyal Subjects, pillaged the Maritime Towns, and forraged the adjacent parts of the Country, ſhut up the mouth of the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> and interrupted the Commerce of Merchants. To repel which violence, the Ships gathered by the Lords ſtruggled in vain, being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way inferiour and weak to ſuppreſs their incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Algarards. On the Land the Forces of thoſe who had ſtood out for the late King had rather been by the laſt conflict ſcatter'd, than throughly broken and brought under. The ableſt and moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Companies which were gathered to his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, having never aſſembled and joyned in one body, the Fight being inconſideratly precipitated and the Dye thrown, before they could deſcend from the far Mountains, and croſs the Ford-leſs Rivers; And of thoſe who were in the Fray not many being taken Priſoners, fewer killed, falling under the weight of friendly Arms.</p>
               <p>The prime Men of thoſe who had choſen rather juſtly to follow the King, than profitably his Rebels, finding themſelves, for their loyalty, and that good will which they had carryed to their Soveraign, perſecuted and proſcrib'd in their Fortunes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:175204:119"/>
inflamed with indignation and ſhame reſolved to oppoſe Wiſdom to Fortune, Courage to Strength, and hazard ſome one day more for the repairing the loſſes of former: the Pillage begun upon the Seas by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> animating them. And being deſirous to make as many fellows of their danger as they could, they ſend Letters throughout all the quarters of the Kingdom to their Friends, Familiars, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, encouraging them to ply the buſineſs ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly, oppoſing their valour and courage to the ſtrength and power of the abuſers of the Prince. By publick Writings they caſt aſperſions on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government. After that Battel of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and ſince the Coronation of the King they had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in the power of a Monarch, but under an <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy,</hi> the moſt depraved from all Governments, the name and Title of a King a young man ſcarce ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years of Age enjoyed, but he Govern'd not, but was by the Killers of his Father miſgoverned, who under falſe pretences intended the ruin of the State. <hi>What reproach and ſhame would it be not only with all men now living but alſo with Poſterity to ſuffer theſe who had hazarded what they had deareſt for the honour and preſervation of their Prince, to be branded with the name of Traytors, be baniſhed and followed to death. Whilſt the Tranſgreſſors and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of all Laws, Divine and Humane, ſit Judges over them, as revengers of general Wrongs, uſurping the Titles of Deliverers of the Country, and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Commonwealth, amongſt whoſe Paws the preſent King could not be aſſured and ſafe, They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the men who to juſtifie their injuſtice, and make their Fact meritorious, brought him in Arms, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether, againſt his King and Father, moſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully taken away, beſides the abuſing of his Name and Authority in every civil matter. The late King
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:175204:120"/>
had loſt the day and himſelf by his own Errors, not by their Power and Deſigns. Now they ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to their proceedings, and though they might be eſteemed inferiour in number to them, yet (if they met together) they might be found equal to them in worth and courage, being puft up by the laſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and only putting their confidence in that they maſtered their Deſigns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much being projected and deſigned for their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Arms, in the North <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Forbeſs,</hi> a Man born neither to reſt himſelf, nor ſuffer others, in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and other Towns on the point of a Launce diſplayed the Shirt of the ſlaughtered King purpled with his blood, inviting the Country as by an Herald to the revenge of his Murther. In the Weſt the Earl of <hi>Lenox,</hi> a man eminent by his Birth and Fortunes hath the ſame reſolution; the Earl of <hi>Marſhal,</hi> Lords <hi>Gordon</hi> and <hi>Lyle,</hi> with their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in other parts of the Kingdom, where their power or eloquence could prevail, move all their Engins to advance the enterprize, and put every thing in readineſs.</p>
               <p>The Lords of the inſurrection having the young King in their hands to countenance their proceedings, joyning diſcretion to their good ſucceſs, determine except upon neceſſity not to ſpill more civil blood. and to diſperſe the Clouds of that appearing Storm, they encourage Sir <hi>Andrew Wood,</hi> now received in favour and brought not only to be an enemy, but to be their friend and fellow-helper (having obtained from them the Barony of <hi>Largow,</hi> diſpoſed to him hereditarily of which before he had only a Leaſe of the late King for his firſt Service) with his Ships to clear the <hi>Forth,</hi> and ſcour the Seas of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And they Launch out to his aſſiſtance the Veſſels and Boats of the Havens near adjacent. At that ſame
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:175204:120"/>
time <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Drummond Stuart</hi> of <hi>Strathern,</hi> a Nobleman, couragious and adventurous, is directed to wait upon the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> ſtopt his ravaging and waſting the Country, and kept him back from joyning with his Confederates of the <hi>North,</hi> and infeſting the more civil parts: being the greateſt, ableſt and neareſt Man of that Faction. The Earl had raiſed many High-land and Weſt-land Men, Recorded to be Two thouſand; but when he could not paſs the River of <hi>Forth</hi> at the Bridg of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> the Lords having inveſted the Town, he aſſayeth to paſs among the Fens and Marſhes at a Ford not far from the head of the River, where other his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates had appointed to meet him. Whilſt he is encamped at <hi>Tilly-moſs,</hi> far from all appearance or ſuſpicion of danger, the Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement of <hi>Alexander Mackealp</hi> (who had taken Arms with the Earl only to find out his ways) in the Night invadeth his Camp, the Sentinels and theſe of the foremoſt Guard ſeized upon, or killed, or driven back, they in the neareſt Cabines amazed with the ſudden miſchief, riſe to Arm themſelves and think of Fight, but finding the danger to be on all ſides, and thorough the whole Camp, neither ſeeing before them, nor hearing any directions given them for the great noiſe of the Invaders, it being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put themſelves in array, confuſedly each over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing other take themſelves to hopeleſs and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered flight. Sleep here to ſome is continued in death, many disburthened themſelves of their Arms, ſeek Sanctuary amongſt the winding paths of theſe Marſhes. Others are taken, but by their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and friends ſuffered after to eſcape.

manifeſt to all the World the candor of their Minds, and juſtice of their proceedings. For that ſome few <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships had ſhut up the narrow Seas of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and interrupted the Commerce of Merchants, pillaging the Coaſts, Order was eſtabliſhed for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many Ships, and that every Seaport ſhould be ſtored with them, as well to maintain traffick abroad with Strangers, as for Fiſhing, and to be Walls to the Country at home. In a matter ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and near concerning the Weal and ſtanding of the State, the Barons were ordained to ſhare and bear a part with the Merchants and Burroughs. And in ſo fair a project, to encourage his people, the King himſelf was content firſt to begin, and to build Ships for his own and the Publick Service of the Kingdom. This being one of the greateſt miſeries of the late King, that he ſuffered himſelf to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>govern'd by (as they term'd them) worthleſs men, ſome Prelates and Noblemen eminent in Learning and Vertue are ſelected who ſhould ſtill be reſident with the King, and of his Council without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, conſent and decree of ſix of which, if any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance were proceeded on and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ſhould be void and null: Governours are appointed to bring up his Brothers.</p>
               <p>Now is every thing ordered to the beſt, Juſtice is executed on oppreſſours and Robbers, and in the remoteſt parts of the Kingdom, the King himſelf in perſon ſeeth it adminiſtred: He is of ſo contrary a temper to the humour of his Predeceſſours that he granted freely to every man what could be demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reaſon. To give a teſtimony to the world of the Agonie of his Mind, for the death of his Father, and what remorſe and anguiſh he ſuffered for the faults of thoſe who brought him to the Field againſt him, he girded himſelf with a chain of Iron, to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:175204:122"/>
which every third year of his Life thereafter he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome rings and weight. Though this might have proved terrible to the Complices of the Crime, yet either out of Conſcience of his gentle diſpoſition and mild nature, and confidence in his generoſity, or of the truſt they had in their own Power and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they bewrayed no ſigns of fear, nor attempted ought againſt the common peace and tranquillity, ſome Records bear that they forewarned him by the example of his Father not to take any violent courſe againſt them, or which might irritate the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and every thing to embrace their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: and that finding him repining and ſtubborn, beyond mediocrity giving himſelf over to Sorrow and penſiveneſs, they threatned him with a Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of his Brothers, telling him it was in their power to make any of the Race of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors their King; if he were head-ſtrong and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory to oppoſe to their wholſom directions and grave Counſels.</p>

                  <hi>The moſt glorious victory a Prince could acquire, was ſometimes to overcome himſelf, and triumph over his diſordered paſſions.

                  <hi>Sith he had done nothing of himſelf, but as a bound man had been carryed away by mutinous Subjects: theſe that lead tranſgreſs, not always they that follow. To theſe men remorſe and torture of conſcience belong'd, it was they ſhould lament and mourn who under falſe pretences had abuſed the people, maskt their ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Malice with a Reformation of errours in the State, whoſe Rage could not be quench't but by the Bloud of their Soveraign.

Father, to himſelf. Revenge belonged to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to whoſe Tribunal he ſhould ſubmit his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. He ſhould not decree the worſt againſt his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Subjects, nor turn them deſperate, as if there were no place to Repent. Great offences, ordinarily were ſeldom puniſht in a State, that it was profitable for a Prince ſometimes to put up voluntarily an injury, the way to be invincible was never to contend, and to ſtand out of danger was the benefit of Peace, that he ſhould apply ſoft Medicine where it was dangerous to uſe violent; That following his Maker he ſhould endeavour to draw good out of evil.</hi>

                  <hi>As he was for that diſaſter of his Father pittied by Men upon Earth, ſo aſſuredly he would be pardon'd in Heaven. If his Subjects returned to their crooked Byas and did revolt again, he would make the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his own, uſe his Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power againſt them till they became obedient, and ſubmitted themſelves to the ſway of his Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ambition was the cauſe of Sedition, which had no limits, and which was the bane and wrack of State and Kingdoms of which they ſhould beware of; King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſubſiſting upon the reputation of a Prince, and that reſpect his Subjects carryed towards him. He was the Eye and Sun of Juſtice; the Prince weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or taken away, or his Authority contemned, the Commonwealth would not only fall into a Decadence, but ſuffer an Earthquake and periſh. Either after by Forrainers be invaded, or by inteſtine diſſentions rent aſunder. Confuſions followed where obedience ceaſed and left: Contempt depoſed Kings as well as

               <p>King <hi>James</hi> graciouſly receiving this young man, told him, <hi>That whatſoever he were, he ſhould not repent him of putting himſelf into his hands,</hi> and

from that time forth, though many gave Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt him as a counterfeit, entertained him every way as a Prince, embraced his quarrel, and ſeiling both his own eyes, and the eyes of the World, he gave conſent that this Duke ſhould take to Wife Lady <hi>Katherine Gordoun</hi> daughter to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> which ſome thought he did to increaſe the Factions of <hi>Perkins</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſtir the diſcontented Subjects againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> and to encourage his own Subjects to ſide on his quarrel.</p>

Some of the Garriſon of the Caſtle obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and having not their minds purged of the late ill-humour of Hoſtility, either ſuſpected them or quarrel'd with them as ſpes, whereupon they fell at ill words, and from words to blows, ſo that many were wounded of either ſide, and the <hi>Scots</hi> (being ſtrangers in the Town) had the worſt: Inſomuch that ſome of them were ſlain, and the reſt made haſte home. The matter being complained on, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten debated before the Wardens of the Marſhes of both ſides, and no good order taken, King <hi>James</hi> took it to himſelf, and ſent <hi>Marchmond</hi> Herauld to the King of <hi>England</hi> to make proteſtation, <hi>That if
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:175204:127"/>
reparation were not done according to the Conditions of the Truce, his King did denounce War.</hi> The King of <hi>England</hi> (who had often tryed fortune, and was enclined to Peace) made anſwer, <hi>That what had been done was utterly againſt his will, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his privity; But if the Garriſon Souldiers had been in fault he would ſee them puniſhed, and the Truce in all points to be preſerved.</hi> This anſwer pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not King <hi>James.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Fox</hi> underſtanding his diſcontent, being troubled that the occaſion of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truce ſhould grow from his men, ſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny humble and deprecatory Letters to the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to appeaſe him. Whereupon King <hi>James</hi> mollified by the Biſhops ſubmiſs and diſcreet Letters, wrote back again unto him, <hi>That though he were in part moved by his Letters, yet he ſhould not be fully ſatisfied except he ſpake with himſelf, as well about the compounding of the preſent differences, as about other matters that might concern the good of both Kingdoms.</hi> The Biſhop adviſing with his Maſter, took his journey to <hi>Scotland:</hi> the meeting was at the Abby of <hi>Melroſe</hi> where the King then abode. The King firſt roundly uttered unto the Biſhop his offence received for the breach of the Truce by his Men at <hi>Norham</hi> Caſtle, after ſpeaking with him apart, he told him, <hi>That theſe temporary Truces, and Peace were ſoon made and ſoon broken: but that he deſired a ſtraiter Amity with the King of</hi> England, <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Mind, that if the King would give him in Marriage the Lady Margaret his eldeſt Daughter, That indeed might be a knot indiſſolvable; That he knew well what Place and Power the Biſhop deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly had with his Maſter; therefore if he would take the buſineſs to heart, and deal in it effectually, he doubted not but it would well ſucceed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop anſwered ſoberly, <hi>That he thought
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:175204:127"/>
himſelf rather happy than worthy, to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a matter, but would do his beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi> Wherefore the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> returning from <hi>Scotland</hi> to his King at <hi>London,</hi> and giving ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what had paſſed, and finding his King more than well diſpoſed in it, gave the King firſt advice to proceed to a concluſion of Peace, and then go on with the Treaty of Marriage by degrees; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Peace was concluded to continue for both the Kings lives, and to the overliver of them one year after. In this Peace there was an Article contained, <hi>That no Engliſh-man ſhould enter into</hi> Scotland, <hi>nor no Scotch-man into</hi> England, <hi>without Letters Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory from the King of either Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this Treaty of the Marriage it is reported that the King of <hi>England</hi> referred this matter to his Council, and that ſome of the Table in freedom of Councellours (the King being preſent) had put the caſe, <hi>That Iſſues Males and Females falling of the Race of his two Sons, that then the Kingdom of</hi> England <hi>would fall to the King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>which might prejudice the Monarchy of</hi> England. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King replyed, <hi>That if any ſuch event ſhould be,</hi> Scotland <hi>would be but an acceſſion to</hi> England, <hi>and not</hi> England <hi>to</hi> Scotland, <hi>for that the greater would draw the leſs, and that it was a ſafer Union for</hi> England <hi>than that of</hi> France.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the eſpouſals of <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with Lady <hi>Margarite</hi> the King of <hi>Englands</hi> eldeſt Daughter followed: which were done by Proxie and in all ſolemn manner.

They had differing Paſſions, and divers wills, often chiding others for diſorder in their behaviour and actions: after much deliberation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that unto which they both conſented.

               <p>Amongſt the Titles of poſſeſſing of Lands in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> there is one, which in proceſs of time of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly cuſtom grew ſtrong and is kept for a Law, being fetched by imitation from the Laws of the neighbouring States; That if the poſſeſſour of Lands die, and leave a Minor to ſucceed to him, his Tutelage belongeth to the King, and the profit of the Lands until the Minor be of the age of One and twenty years. This is of thoſe Lands which are termed Wards. The King cauſeth bring up his Wards, but beſtoweth no more of their Rents upon them than is uſeful to ſuch of that age. By another Law they have not any thing better than this, which they call <hi>Recognition,</hi> that if the evidences of any Poſſeſſour of Ward-lands be not in all points formal, and above exceptions of Law, the Lands (the poſſeſſours put from them) ſhall return to the Lords Superiour: and like to this, That if a Poſſeſſour of Ward-Lands without the conſent of the Superiour, ſell and put away the half, or above the half of his Land and Farm, the whole Land and Farm return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Superiour or Lord Paramount.

The King was ſo dearly beloved of his People, that in the height of thoſe Grievances (which reached near the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Avarice of his Father) none refuſed or made difficulty to give all that the Laws ordained. The King ſeeing their willingneſs to perform and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their great diſability thereunto, out of his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Grace and Goodneſs remitteth not only the rigour, but even the equity almoſt of his Laws, inſomuch that thereafter none of his Subjects were damnified in their Perſons or Eſtates by his proceedings: which gain'd him the hearts of all: And to put away all ſuſpicions and jealouſies from their minds (an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Practice amongſt Princes) acts that fill Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Coffers ever being the ruine of their firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors, of any wrong intended, He ſuffered the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and Projectors of this Poling, with others of the moſt active to be thrown into Priſons, where ſome miſerably ended their days.</p>

               <p>Monſieur <hi>de la Motte</hi> was come with Letters from the <hi>French</hi> to ſtir <hi>King James</hi> to take Arms againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and had in his Voyage drowned three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, bringing ſeven with him as Prizes to the Harbour of <hi>Leyth.

               <p>The King thinking himſelf already engaged and intereſted in his Fame, drawn away by the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Eloquence, and other perſuaſions of the <hi>French,</hi> aſſembleth the three Eſtates of his Kingdom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate about a War with <hi>England.</hi> Many oppoſe it, but in vain; for at laſt for fear of the King's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure it is concluded, uncertain whether by a worſe Counſel or event.

                  <hi>Henry,</hi> the Eight then Beſieging <hi>Therovenne,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Herauld who delivered his Commiſſion: That he heard nothing from him, but what he had expected from a King a Deſpiſer of God's and Man's Law; for himſelf, he would not give over a War ſo happily begun for any threats.

               <p>
                  <hi>We are not ignorant that here will be objected againſt us, the breach of a League contracted between our Brother and Us: We have not broken that League; but for great Cauſes and Reaſons ſeparate our ſelves from it, our Brother having taken away the means, occaſions, reaſons, were had to obſerve it. In all Leagues, Confederations, Alliances and Promiſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Princes, the laſt Confederation is ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be contracted without prejudice to the Rights of any former Alliances: and when our Embaſſadours made that League with our Brother, it was to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:175204:135"/>
that it ſhould hold no longer, nor we longer be bound unto it than he ſhould keep to our firſt Allies and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Confederates, not breaking their Peace, nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Government and Eſtates of their Countries. A National League is ever to be preferred before any perſonal, an ancient to a new; the Leagues between the Kingdoms of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued many ages, ſhould juſtly be preferr'd to that which we as a new Ally of the Houſe of</hi> England <hi>did contract, which yet we are moſt willing to keep: but the love of our Country paſſing all private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects hath moved us to ſeparate our ſelves for a time from it.</hi>

                  <hi>All Leagues, Confederations, Alliances, Promiſes amongſt Princes are reſpectively and mutually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, with this condition and Law, providing both keep upon either ſide; the one party breaking or departing from the League, Alliance or promiſe, the other is no longer bound to keep or adhere unto it. So long as the King of</hi> England <hi>kept unto us, we kept unto him: He now having many ways broken to us, we are no longer obliged to keep to him; That ſame Oath which obliged and tyed us, after his breach ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving and making us free; and of this we divers times advertiſed him, giving him aſſurance, except we would betray that Truſt and confidence our Subjects and Confederates had in us for the maintenance of their Peace and ſafety, we could not but aſſiſt them in their juſt cauſe (howſoever the juſteſt actions have not ever the moſt profitable events) and be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a recourſe to Arms for a remedy of their preſent miſery.</hi>

               <p>Whileſt the King ſtayed at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> attending the gathering of his Army, now ready to ſet forward, and full of cares and perplexity, in the Church of St. <hi>Michael</hi> heard Evenſong (as then it was called) while he was at his Devotion, an ancient Man came in, his Amber coloured locks hanging down upon his ſhoulders, his forehead high and enclining to baldneſs, his Garment of Azure colour, ſomewhat long girded about him with a Towel, or Table Napkin, of a comely and reverent Aſpect. Having enquired for the King, he intruded himſelf into the Preaſe, paſſing thorow till he came to him, with a clowniſh ſimplicity, leaning over the Canons Seat where the King ſate, Sir (ſaid he) I am ſent hither to intreat you for this time to delay your expedition, and to proceed no farther in your intended journey: for if you do, ye ſhall not proſper in your enterprize, nor any of your followers. I am farther charged to warn you, if ye be ſo refractory as to go forward, not to uſe the acquaintance, company, or counſel of Women, as ye tender your Honour, Life, and Eſtate.</p>
               <p>After this warning he withdrew himſelf back again into the Preaſe; when Service was ended, the King enquired earneſtly, for him, but he could no
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:175204:136"/>
where be found, neither could any of the ſtanders by (of whom diverſe did narrowly obſerve him, meaning afterwards to have diſcourſed further with him) feel or perceive how, when, or where he paſſed from them: having as it were vaniſhed in their hands.</p>
               <p>After this Army had muſtered in the Borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> (a field then ſpacious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful by the ſhades of many ſtately and aged Oaks) about the midſt of the Night there is a Proclamation heard at the Market Croſs of the Town, ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great many Burgeſſes, Gentlemen, Barons, Noblemen to appear within fourty days before the Tribunal of one <hi>Plot-Cock;</hi> the Provoſt of the Town in his Timber Gallery having heard his own Name cited, cried out that he declined that Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and appeal'd to the mercy of God Almighty.</p>
               <p>Nothing was the King moved with thoſe adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, thinking them Scenick pieces acted by thoſe who hated the <hi>French</hi> and favoured the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Faction: being ſo boldly and to the Life perſonated that they appalled and ſtroke with fear ordinary and vulgar judgments, as Trage-Comedies of Spirits. The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> diſſuaded him from that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and many of the moſt reverend Church-men, but the Angel which moſt conjured him was <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garite</hi> his Queen who at that time was with child; her tears and prayers ſhook the ſtrongeſt beams of his Reſolutions. She had acquainted him with the Viſions and affrightments of her ſleep; that her Chains and Armelets appeared to be turned into Pearls; She had ſeen him fall from a great Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice; She had loſt one of her Eyes. When he had anſwered theſe were but Dreams, ariſing from the many thoughts and cares of the Day, but it is no Dream (ſaith ſhe) that ye have but one Son, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:175204:136"/>
him a weakling; if otherways than well happen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, what a lamentable day will that be, when ye ſhall leave behind you, to ſo tender and weak a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, under the Government of a Woman, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, a miſerable and bloody War? It is no dream that ye are to Fight a mighty People; now turned inſolent by their riches at home and power abroad: that your Nobility are indigent ye know, and may be brib'd to leave you in your greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. What a folly, what a blindneſs is it to make this War yours, and to quench the fire in your Neighbours Houſe of <hi>France,</hi> to kindle and burn up your own in <hi>Scotland?</hi> ye have no ſuch reaſon to aſſiſt the <hi>French,</hi> as ye have to keep your promiſes to <hi>England,</hi> and enjoy a Peace at home. Though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould make a Conqueſt of <hi>France,</hi> will they take your Crown, or diſinherit their own Race, this is even as the left hand would cut off the right? Should the Letters of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> (a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man twice married (the firſt half in Adultery, the laſt almoſt Inceſt) whom he did never nor ſhall ever ſee) prove more powerful with you, than the cryes of your little Son, and mine, than the tears, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, curſes of the Orphans, and Widows which ye are to make? If ye will go, ſuffer me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany you; it may be my Country-men prove more kind towards me, than they will to you; and for my ſake yield unto a Peace. I hear the Queen my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will be with the Army in her Husbands abſence; if we ſhall meet, who knows what God by our means may bring to paſs.</p>
               <p>The King anſwered all her complaints with a ſpeedy March which he made over the <hi>Tweed:</hi> not ſtaying till the whole Forces came to him, which were ariſing and prepared.</p>
               <p>The twenty two of <hi>Auguſt</hi> coming into <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:175204:137"/>
he encamped near the water of <hi>Twiſel</hi> in <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> where at <hi>Twiſel-haugh</hi> he made an Act, That if any man were ſlain or hurt to death by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> during the time of his abode in <hi>England,</hi> his Heirs ſhould have his Ward, Relief, and Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. <hi>Norham, Wark, Foord, Eatel</hi> are taken and caſt down. Amidſt this Hoſtility the Lady <hi>Foord</hi> (a noble Captive) was brought in a pitty-pleading manner, with her daughter (a Maid of excellent beauty) to the Camp. Not without the Earl of <hi>Surreys</hi> direction, as many ſuppoſed, for they have a vigorous Prince and his Son (though natural by the gifts of Nature and Education above many law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) to try the Magick of their Eloquence and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon. The King delighting in their Company, not only hearkneth to the diſcourſe of the Mother, but giveth way to her counſel; which was, if ſhe ſhould be diſmiſſed, to ſend him true and certain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would attempt, taking her way to their Camp: but in effect proved the winning of time to the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and the loſing of occaſion to him. Her few days ſtay bred in him a kind of careleſneſs, ſloath, procraſtination and delay, a neglect, and as it were a forgetfulneſs of his Army and buſineſs: eighteen days tarrying in <hi>England,</hi> in a Territory not very fertile, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd much Proviſion, the Souldiers began to want neceſſaries, a number in the Night by blind paths re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own Country. In a ſhort time only the Noblemen and their Vaſſals attended the King. Theſe requeſt him not to ſpend more time on that barren Soyl, but to turn their Forces againſt <hi>Berwick,</hi> which Town was of more importance, than all the Hamlets and poor Villages of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it impregnable or difficil to be taken, the Town and Caſtle being no ways provided and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:175204:137"/>
to endure a Siege. The Courtiers move the King to continue the Beleaguering of <hi>Berwick</hi> till their coming back: which would be an eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, <hi>Northumberland</hi> once forrag'd, in abſence of the braveſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt the Army languiſhed, and the King ſpent time at <hi>Foord,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> directeth a Herauld to his Camp, requiring him either to leave off the Invaſion of his Maſters Country, and turn back giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction for wrongs committed; or that he would appoint a day and place wherein all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be ended by the Sword. This Challenge being adviſed in Counſel, moſt voices were that they ſhould return home, and not with ſo ſmall number as remained endanger the State of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, enough being already atchieved for Fame, and too much for their friendſhip with <hi>France;</hi> why ſhould a few Souldiers, and theſe already tired out by forcing of Strengths, throwing down Caſtles, be hazarded againſt ſuch multitudes of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſupplyed lately and encreaſed with freſh Auxiliaries? <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Admiral, a Son of the Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> having newly brought with him to <hi>New Caſtle</hi> out of the Army lying in <hi>France</hi> Five thouſand Men, and One thouſand tall Sea men. If they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Home, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army could not but disband, and not conveniently this year be gathered again, conſiſting of Men Levied from far and diſtant Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Again, if they ſhould be engaged to come to a Battle; their own Country, being fields to them well known, would prove more commodious and ſecure to Fight upon than <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground, beſides the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of furniſhing and providing the Camp with all neceſſaries at leſs charges. The <hi>French</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and others of his Faction remonſtrate to the King, what a ſhameful retreat he would make, if at
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:175204:138"/>
the deſire of the Enemy he returned, and without the hazard of a Battle, being ſo near unto him; that by Fighting in <hi>England,</hi> he kept his own Country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forraged; and conſum'd the Proviſion of his Enemy which at laſt would weaken his Forces: That for contentment to both Armies, <hi>Islay</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld ſhould return with <hi>Rouge-Croſs</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and condeſcend upon a day, promiſing them the mean time tarrying and abode, till the righteouſneſs of the cauſe were decided in a Battle.</p>
               <p>The ſet and appointed Day by the Heraulds in which the two Armies ſhould have joyned being come and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> not appearing, nor any from them: The Nobility again reſort to the King; ſhow how by the ſlight of the Enemy matters were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed from one day to another: the <hi>Engliſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces daily encreaſing. whilſt the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> were away and waxed fewer: that ſlight ſhould be oppoſed to ſlight; the day deſigned by the Heraulds not being kept, it would be no reproach to them to turn home without Battle, or if retiring, to Fight upon their own ground. If this Counſel pleaſe him not, but that he would there give them Battle, The next was to ſtudy all advantages for Victory, either by Stratagem, or the odds and furtherance of the Place of Fight; Where the <hi>Chiviot</hi> hills decline towards the plainer Fields ariſing behind them with high tops with beſt Ordnance ſhould be fortified, the water of <hi>Till</hi> running deep and ford-leſs upon the right hand, and but paſſable at the Bridge, the firſt Companies of the Enemy being paſſed, before they could be relieved and ſuccoured by their followers, the Bridge by the Artillery ſhould be beaten down, and the Enemy charged when they began to paſs the Water.</p>
               <p>The King, impatient of Counſel, anſwered,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:175204:138"/>
though their number encreaſed to as many more as they were, he with that remainder of his Army would Fight them. That advantages were to be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced according to the occaſion of the Fight without tedious deliberation, if any man was afraid, he might if he pleaſed return Home. A ſtrange Reſolution in a Prince, who imagined every man in his Army to have the ſame ſtrength, courage, boldneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution with himſelf</p>
               <p>This anſwer aſtoniſhed the Mobility, and ſince they could not perſuade him to a fair retreat, but that he will fight and that without the advantage of the Bridge, being inferiour in number to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> (for they were reckoned by the Scouts Six and twenty thouſand) they fortifie themſelves according to the commodity of the Hill where they lay En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with a Reſolution not to ſuffer the King to hazard his Perſon in the Battle. If Victory ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to them, their Gains were but ſmall, and Glory leſs, extending but over ſome few of the Nobility, and a ſmall parcel of the Body of the State of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> a number of Yeomen, and preſſed Horſemen, the flower of the Kingdom being in <hi>France.</hi> But if they were overthrown, their loſs would prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable, yea unſpeakable, a Martial young King either kill'd, taken, or put to flight; wherefore they think it fitting, not neceſſary, the King be pleaſed with ſo many as either chance or election might ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate with him, to be a ſpectator of the Fortune of the Day. To this the King replyed, He neither wanted ability to diſcharge the part of a Souldier, nor wiſdom to Command as a General, and to out-live ſo many valiant Country-man would be more terrible to him than Death it ſelf. When forced to give way for his perſonal preſence in the Field; they appoint ſome to be arrayed in like furniture of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:175204:139"/>
Arms and a like Guard as the King; Shadows to perſonate him in ſundry quarters of the Field, that the Enemy ſhould not ſet one man as their chief mark to invade, from whoſe death the victory and concluſion of the War might depend: and if the King ſhould fall, the Army ſhould not loſe courage, nor be brought to believe he were loſt, ſo long as they ſaw a General with his Cognoſcance and Guard preſent and near them to be a witneſs of their Valour and Atchievments, as not long before at the Battle of <hi>Fornou</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> had been practiſed by the <hi>French</hi> to their King <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth.</p>
               <p>By this time the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> with the power of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> was come within three miles of the Place where the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army was encamped, and perceiving he could not but with great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage fight them; he ſendeth an Herauld requiring the King to come forth of his Strength to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ground, where he would be ready to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. The King being forward to condeſcend to this requeſt, the Lords cryed out, it was madneſs to accept of opportunity of fighting from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to ſet all at a main chance according to their appointment, it being their advantage to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long time, and trifle with him, in whoſe Camp there was already ſcarcity of Victuals, which ere long might put him to ſuch a ſtand, that he ſhould not know well what to do. Neither was it likely he could be furniſhed from the inner parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, by reaſon of the cumberſom waies for carriage to paſs, after the falling of ſo great and continued rains, and the ſoftning of the Ground; that by ſitting ſtill, and committing nothing to Fortune, he might have his enemy at his pleaſure; if they dared aſſail him at their perils be it. He lacked nothing but patience to be Victorious.</p>

The middle Ward which the King led, with which now the Earl of <hi>Bothwel</hi> with the power of <hi>Lothian</hi> was joyned, fought it out couragiouſly body againſt body, and Sword to Sword. Numbers upon either ſide falling till darkneſs, and the black ſhadows of the Night, forced as it were, by conſent of both, a Retreat: Neither of them underſtanding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the day, and unto whom Victory appertained.</p>
               <p>Many brave <hi>Scots</hi> did here fall, eſteemed to above Five thouſand, of the nobleſt and worthieſt Families of the Kingdom: who chooſed rather to die than out-live their friends and Compatriots.</p>
               <p>

               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> left few leſs upon the place, but moſt part of them being of the common ſort of Souldiers, and men of no great mark, compared with ſo many Nobles killed, and a King loſt, the number was not eſteemed nor the loſs thought any thing of.</p>
               <p>The Companies of the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> had reſerved themſelves all the time of the Fight, keeping their firſt Order, and when by the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> he was required to relieve the Battalions where the King fought, he is ſaid to have anſwered, That that man did well that day who ſtood and ſaved himſelf.

               <p>About the dawning of the next Morning the Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> with his Horſe-Troops taking a view of the Field, and ſeeing the brazen Ordnance of the <hi>Scots</hi> not tranſported, with moſt part of the faln Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not rifled, ſendeth ſpeedy advertiſement to the <hi>Howards</hi> and the penſive Army: inviting all to the ſetting up of Trophies, Spoil, and tranſporting of their great Ordnance to <hi>Berwick,</hi> amongſt which

               </p>
               <p>Divers diverſly report of the Fortune of the King; We without affirming any thing for certain, ſhall only ſet down what Fame hath publiſhed, a falſe Witneſs often of Human Accidents, and which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by malignant brains is forged, and by more malignant Ears received and believed. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> hold that he was killed in this Battle; the <hi>Scots</hi> that many in like Arms with the like Guards, were killed, every one of which was held for the King: Amongſt others <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Elphinſtoun</hi> his Favourite, who had married <hi>Elizabeth Barley</hi> one of the Dames of Honour of Queen <hi>Margarite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man not unlike to the King in face and ſtature, and repreſenting him in Arms in the Field, with the valianteſt and moſt couragious of the Army fought it out, and acting Heroically his part, as a King was killed, heaps of ſlaughtered bodies envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roning his. In the ſearch where the Fight was, the number, taleneſs, furniture of the dead bodies being obſerved, their Faces and Wounds viewed, his body as if it breathed yet Majeſty, was amidſt the others ſelected, acknowledged for his Maſters, brought to <hi>Berwick</hi> and embalmed. That it was not the body of the King, the girdle of Iron which he ever wore, and then was not found about him, gave ſome, though not certain, teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Some have Recorded, that the fortune of the day inclining to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> four tall men mounted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on luſty Horſes, wearing upon the points of their Launces, for cognoſcances, Streamers of Straw, mounting the King on a Sorrel Hackney, convoyed him far from the place of fight, and that he was ſeen beyond the <hi>Tweed,</hi> between <hi>Kelſo</hi> and <hi>Dunce.</hi> After which what became of him was uncertain. Many
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:175204:141"/>
hold he was killed in the Caſtle of <hi>Hume,</hi> either by the intelligence between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> kindred, or out of fear (for they were at the ſlaughter of the Kings Father and the moſt violent in that Fight) or of hopes of great fortunes, which would follow innovations, and the confuſion of the State, being men who liv'd beſt in a troubl'd Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and upon the Borders.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Carr</hi> a follower of the Lord <hi>Humes,</hi> that ſame night the Battle was fought, thruſt the Abbot of <hi>Kelſo</hi> out of his Abbacy: which he never durſt attempt, the King being alive. Another, <hi>David Carbreth</hi> in the time of <hi>John</hi> the Governour vaunted that however <hi>John</hi> wronged the <hi>Humes,</hi> he was one of ſix who had abated the inſolency of King <hi>James,</hi> and brought him to know he was a Mortal. To theſe is added, that the Governour <hi>John,</hi> not long hereafter, cut of the Heads of the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> and his Brother without any known great cauſe. The Common people (ever more addicted to Superſtition than Verity) believed he was living, and had paſſed over the Seas, and according to his promiſe viſited the Holy Sepulchre in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> There for his other offences and the bearing of Arms againſt his Father, in Prayers and Pennance he ſpent the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his tedious days.</p>
               <p>That he would return again when he found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and the neceſſity of <hi>Europe</hi> requir'd him. This report was of as great truth, as that which the <hi>Burgundians</hi> have of the Return of their Duke <hi>Charles</hi> after the Battle of <hi>Nancy,</hi> moſt of them believing he eſcaped from the conflict. He was loſt the twenty and five year of his Reign, the thirty and ninth of his Age the Ninth of <hi>September</hi> One thouſand five hundred and thirteen.</p>
               <p>This King was of a vigorous body, his ſtature
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:175204:142"/>
being neither too tall nor too low, of a pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, of a pregnant wit; but by the faults of the times in which he lived, not poliſhed with Letters. He excelled in Horſe-manſhip, Fencing and Shooting. By much watching, ſlender diet, and uſe, he was enabled to endure all extremities of Weather, Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or want of reſt, with good health of body.</p>
               <p>He was juſt in giving judgment, in puniſhing Malefactors ſevere, yet tractable and moderate. With the peril of ſome few he reſtrained vices and rather ſhook the Sword than ſtruck with it. He knew there were ſome things, though Princes might, yet they ought not to do. He was eaſie of acceſs, moſt courteous in ſpeech, and meek in anſwering every man. He was ſo far from being overtaken with anger or other violent perturbations, that he was never obſerved to have given an evil or diſobliging word to any, or that the colour of his face changed by any offence offered him, or informations given him, relying without paſſion upon his own magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity.</p>
               <p>He was of a free and liberal diſpoſition, far from any oſtentation. As he underſtood well the Art of giving, ſo to acquire and purchaſe he was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of himſelf, but made uſe of men who drew more hatred upon their own heads, than moneys into their Princes Coffers.</p>
               <p>Though he delighted more in War than the Arts, he was a great admirer and advancer of learned men. <hi>William Elphinſtoun</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> builded by his Liberality the College of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and named it The King's College, by reaſon of thoſe Privileges and Rents the King beſtowed upon it</p>
               <p>His Generoſity did ſhew it ſelf in not delivering of <hi>Perkin Warbeck;</hi> he truſted much, and had great confidence in his Nobility, and governed by love not by fear, his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:175204:142"/>It is no wonder amidſt ſo much worth, that ſome humane frailty, and ſome according Diſcord be found. There is no day ſo bright and fair, which one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or other looketh not pale, and remaineth not with ſome dampiſh ſhadow of diſcoloured Clouds. He was ſomewhat wedded to his own humours opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionative and raſh; <hi>Actions of raſhneſs and temerity, even although they may have an happy event, being never praiſe worthy in a Prince. He was ſo infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that Illuſtrious crime which the Ambitious take for vertue, deſire of Fame, that he preferred it to his own life, and the peace of his Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſo affected Popularity, and endeavoured to purchaſe the love of his People, by Largeſſes, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting, and other Magnificence, diving in debt, that by thoſe Subſidies and exceſſive Exactions which of neceſſity he ſhould have been conſtrained to have levied and ſqueezed from the People, longer life had made him loſe all that favour and love he had ſo painfully purchaſed, that death ſeemed to have come to him wiſhedly and in good time.</p>
               <p>The wedding of others quarrels, eſpecially of the <hi>French,</hi> ſeemeth in him inexcuſable; a wiſe Prince ſhould be ſlow and loath to engage himſelf in a War, although he hath ſuffered ſome wrong. He ſhould conſider that of all humane actions and hazards, there is not one of which the precipitation is ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as that of beginning and undertaking a War. Neither in Human Affairs ſhould there more depths be ſounded nor hidden paſſages ſearched and pryed into than in this. He ſhould remember that beſides the ſad neceſſity which is inſeparable from the moſt innocent War (the waſting and deſtroying of the Goods and Lives of much people) there is nothing of which the Revolutions and Changes are more inconſtant, and the concluſions and ends more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:175204:143"/>The Sea is not more treacherous, falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, nor changeth not more ſwiftly her calms into ſtorms, than Wars and the fortune of Arms do, the event and ſucceſs belying the beginning. It is not enough that a Prince know a War which he undertaketh to be juſt, but he ſhould conſider alſo if it be neceſſary, and if it be profitable, and conduce to the State which he governeth.</p>
               <p>As Men of ſtrong and healthful bodies follow ordinary delight in their youth, he was amorouſly carried away. He confined the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Arran,</hi> for taking <hi>Jane Kennedy</hi> a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Caſſilles</hi> out of <hi>Galloway,</hi> a fair and noble Lady, of whom he became ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured as he went in his Pilgrimage to St. <hi>Ninians.</hi> In his laſt Expedition the Lady <hi>Foord</hi> was thought to have hindred the progreſs of his Arms, and haſten'd the ſucceſs of the Battle.</p>
               <p>Though vertue be ſometimes unfortunate, yet is it ever in an high eſteem in the memories of Men: ſuch a deſire remained of him in the hearts of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after his loſs, that the like was not of any King before him; Princes who are out of this Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the delights and darlings of a People. <hi>Ann</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Queen not many days out-lived the rumour of his death. He ſerves for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the frailty of great men on the Theatre of this world, and of the inconſtancy of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things.</p>
               <p>He had children, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Arthur</hi> who dyed Infants, <hi>James</hi> who ſucceeded him, <hi>Alexander</hi> born after his death who dyed young; <hi>Alexander</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son, Arch-Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> ſo much admired and courted by <hi>Eraſmus; Margarite</hi> a Daughter of the Lord <hi>Drummonds,</hi> married to the Earl of <hi>Huntley,</hi> whoſe Mother had been contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>THe fatal accident and overthrow of the King, and Flower of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>Flowden</hi> filled the remnant of the State with great ſorrow, but with great amazement and perplexity: for by this great change they expected no leſs than the progreſs and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Victors Arms and Fortune, and feared the Conqueſt, Servitude, and Deſolation of the whole Kingdom. The rigorous ſeaſon of the year being ſpent in mourning, and performing of laſt duties to the dead for their loſt kinſmen and friends; and the gathering together the floating Ribs and diſperſed Planks of this Ship-wrack, the Pears aſſembled at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where being, applying themſelves to ſet their confuſions in order, and determine on the Remedies of their preſent evils, the lively pourtraict of their Calamities did repreſent it ſelf to the full view. The Head and faireſt parts which Majeſty, Authority,

Direction, Wiſdom had made eminent, were cut away, ſome turbulent Church-men, Orphant-No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and timorous Citizens, fill their vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: and many who needed directions themſelves, were placed to direct and guide the Helm of State; ſuch miſeries being always incident to a People, where the Father of the Country is taken away, and the Succeſſour is of under age. In this Maze of perplexity to diſoblige themſelves of their greateſt duty, and give ſatisfaction to the moſt and beſt, the Lawful Succeſſour and Heir <hi>JAMES</hi> the Prince is ſet on the Throne and Crowned, being at that time One year, five months and ten days of Age, and the hundred and fifth King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The laſt Will and Teſtament which the late King had left before his expedition, being publickly ſeen and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, the Queen challenges the Protection of the Realm and Tutelage of her Son, as diſpoſed unto her ſo long as ſhe continued a Widdow and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Counſel and advice of the Chancellour of the Realm, and ſome other grave Counſellours, and ſhe obtained it: as well out of a Religion they had to fulfil the Will of their deceaſed Sovereign, as to ſhun and be freed of the imminent Arms, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of her Brother the King of <hi>England.</hi> Being eſtabliſhed in the Government, and having from all that reſpect, reverence, and obſervance which belong to ſuch a Princeſs, ſhe ſent Letters to the King of <hi>England;</hi> that having compaſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tears and prayers of a Widdow, of his Siſter, of an Orphan, of his Nephew, he would not only ceaſe from following the War upon <hi>Scotland</hi> (then at War with it ſelf and many ways divided) but ennobled by courage and goodneſs, be a defence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her and the Infant her Son, againſt all injuries to be offered them by Forrainers abroad, of any of the

               <p>The Government of a Woman and a Child over a People ever in Motion, mutinous and delighting in Changes, could not long ſubſiſt firm, nor continue after one faſhion. The firſt ſhake and diſorders of the Kingdom aroſe, and was occaſioned by the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice of the Church-men (the Moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms of State) being ſeconded by the Factious Nobles and Male-contents; and it was the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Offices, Places, Benefices, vacant by the deaths of thoſe ſlain in the late Battel. <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Burges,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Murray,</hi> and Legate to the Pope <hi>Julius, Gavin Dowglaſs</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Dunkel,</hi> Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Anguſs, John Hepburn</hi> Prior of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> contend all three for the Arch-biſhoprick of St. <hi>Andrews. Gavin Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> was preſented to it by the Queen, <hi>Andrew For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> by the Pope, <hi>John Hepburn</hi> was choſen by the Chapter his Canons; and ſundry of the Nobility favoured his Election, they ſaid alſo the place whilſt
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:175204:147"/>
it was vacant belonged unto him: and his Party was ſo ſtrong that none dared publiſh the Popes Bull in favour of <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> for many days. Till <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Hume</hi> then Chamberlain and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Eaſt Marſhes, won by many promiſes, and the Abbacy of <hi>Coldingham</hi> engaged and preſently given in hand to his younger Brother <hi>David,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the oppoſition or the Lord <hi>Haylles</hi> and the Faction of the <hi>Hepburns,</hi> then ſeditious and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, well backed by his Friends, Vaſſals, Adherents all in Arms, cauſed publiſh, and proclaim it at the Market croſs of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which action firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed the Prior to Plot miſchief againſt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Humes. William Elphinſtoun</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> by many of the Clergy and ſome of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had been deſired to accept this Dignity, but he refuſed it, being now weary of earthly greatneſs, and making for another World, for at this time at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he left this.</p>
               <p>As ordinarily when one Faction is near extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the remnant ſubdivideth, after theſe jars of the Church-men, which were cheriſhed by the Nobility, the Nobles began to jar among themſelves, and grudge at others preferments. <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> ruled and commanded the Countries North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the River of <hi>Forth,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Hume</hi> Uſurped almoſt a Royal Authority, and commanded over the Countreys on South-ſide of the <hi>Forth,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> went about a fairer Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> Lord <hi>Hamiltown</hi> being near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in blood to the King, could not but with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation look upon the undeſerved greatneſs of theſe Uſurpers, under the ſhadow of this <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, evil diſpoſed, and men abhorring quietneſs ravaged the Country and did what they pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe confuſions the Queen in <hi>April</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:175204:147"/>
brought forth the poſthumous child in the Caſtle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> whom the Biſhop of <hi>Cathneſs,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fermlin,</hi> and the Arch-Dean of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> baptized and named <hi>Alexander.</hi> After ſhe was recovered and had required her wonted ſtrength of Body, ſhe found the Authority of her place was turned weak, and that ſhe enjoyed nothing but the name of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, the people delighting to live rather with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rule and in all diſorders than to be ſubject to the obedience of a Woman though a Queen. After great deliberation and many eſſays in vain to curb their inſolency and vindicate her Authority from their contempt, as alſo to ſave her Son from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of an inſulting Nobility, and ſettle her eſtate, ſhe reſolved to Match with ſome Nobleman eminent in Power and worth, who could and would Protect her and hers in greateſt extremities. Amongſt the choice of the young Noblemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> for a long Succeſſion of renowned Anceſtors, comelineſs of Perſon, noble converſation, prudence in affairs of State, being lovely, courteous, liberal, wiſe, none was comparable to the Earl of <hi>Angus;</hi> him ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to make Partner of her Royal Bed and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; and as ordinarily in matters of love it falleth out by the impatience of delay, without acquainting her Brother the King of <hi>England,</hi> or the Nobles of the Kingdom with her deſign, ſhe afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth him, transferring, if ſhe could, the whole weight of the Kingdom and the reins of the Government of the State into his hands, having no more freedom in her own determinations.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this revealed to the World, when the Nobility and Gentry divided into two Factions, one adhering to the <hi>Dowglaſs,</hi> in whom kindred, friendſhip long obſervance had bred hopes of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and preferment: another of ſuch whom envy of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:175204:148"/>
his greatneſs and advancement had made hungry of change The firſt would have the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Queens perſon and her husband's; becauſe hereby the Realm ſhould ſtill have peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which at that time was the moſt neceſſary point to be reſpected. The adverſe Party, of which the Lord Chamberlain was the Principal, who was a man both in Power, Parentage, Riches, equal if not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, to many of the great Men of the Country, importuned the Election of a new Governour and Protector of the young King. The Queen loſing by her marriage both the tutelage of her Son and the Government, ſhould not take to heart that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were choſen and put in her place.</p>
               <p>Her marrying the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> had made him too great already to be a Subject; the continuing of her in Authority would promote him to the greatneſs of a Prince. Who ſhould be Governour, is upon both ſides long and contentiouſly argued. Many gave their voices for the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> as being near in blood to the King, and a man affecting peace more than others, and every way ſufficient for ſuch a Charge. The Chamberlain had determined of another, and told it was a wrong to bar from ſo high an honour a man of the Maſculine line in blood to the King, and prefer one of the Femine. <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Son to <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> the Brother of King <hi>James</hi> the Third, before all others by all reaſon ſhould be preferred to the Government. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded if he would the firſt, to gave example to others, ſet his hand to this Election, he without pauſing performed it, with a proteſtation, that though the reſt of the Nobility oppoſed it, as to his coming into <hi>Scotland</hi> to accept the Government, he alone would go to <hi>France,</hi> charge him with it, be his Convoy hither, and maintain his Title.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:175204:148"/>This he was thought to have done, for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to reach and obtain this Dignity himſelf, out of emulation he laid a deſign that never any other of the Nobles of the Kingdom ſhould reach it: affecting rather to give a Stranger the place than a Competitor, bringing in the <hi>French</hi> to equal the ballance as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, himſelf only as acceſſory, nothing doubting of a chief place in State, as well for his forwardneſs in this election as for the neceſſity of his Service which the <hi>French</hi> could not well want, and ſhould never be lacking. He feared alſo if the Faction of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> prevail'd, the greatneſs of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> would be an umbrage to his, and leſſen &amp; impair it; Their Lands &amp; Fortunes lying near to other, as that the Queen by her power in <hi>England</hi> would croſs his faireſt projects.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> had ſent a Letter to the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> (as he had done to the <hi>French</hi> King for that ſame effect) remonſtrating how dangerous it was for the State of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and young King, if they ſhould make choice of the Duke of <hi>Albany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of all which through ambition, malice, envy of others, diſcords amongſt themſelves, they made choice of this Gentleman, a ſtranger by his education and birth, ignorant of the nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Scots:</hi> whoſe Father was baniſhed for Treaſon againſt his Brother, and dyed unreſtored. One altogether devoted to the <hi>French</hi> King, and an enemy to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> not caring to keep the Country of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Wars and Troubles, ſo he might defend the <hi>French</hi> Nation, by making the <hi>Scots</hi> fight their battels.</p>
               <p>After many private Letters from his Friends in <hi>Scotland</hi> (eſpecially from the Chamberlain) inviting him to come home and accept his new dignity, the Duke at laſt is required by the State, and Lyon King of Arms is directed to him, to acquaint him with their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:175204:149"/>
proceedings, and make him forward on his way. He to endear his coming and make himſelf the more deſired of the People, excuſing his ſtay for a while (which he laid upon the Treaty of Peace, which was then to be agreed upon between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> by the marriage of <hi>Lovys</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King with <hi>Mary</hi> the youngeſt Siſter of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> which required his preſence) ſendeth home the King of Arms with Letters from the <hi>French</hi> King, with Sir <hi>Anthony Darcea le Siour de la Beautie.</hi> This manpropounded certain conditions which the Duke required. What ſhould be the form of his Government, his Guards, what Caſtles ſhould be delivered to him for his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons; the reſtoring his patrimony and Fathers digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to him. Which particularities being condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar</hi> was inſtantly delivered to <hi>la Beautie</hi> to be kept for a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon at the Dukes coming: and Sir <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Arran, James Oguilbuy</hi> Abbot of <hi>Arbroth</hi> with the King of Arms, were ſent back again to <hi>France.</hi> After their Arrival the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> furniſhed with all neceſſaries by the <hi>French King</hi> with eight well rigged Ships took the Seas, and in the month of <hi>May</hi> arrived on the Weſt coaſts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence with a great retinue of the Nobles and Barons of the Country by eaſie journeys, the Queen meeting him, he came to the Town of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> In the Parliament which had been prorogued for his coming, the Duke accepted the Government, and gave his Oath of fidelity to the King and Country: and the three Eſtates gave their Oath of obedience to him, and both ſwore in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, neither ſhould be deficient to others. Here is he reſtored to all his Fathers inheritance, Titles and honours. Being declared Duke of <hi>Albany,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the Kingdom till the King's
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:175204:149"/>
full maturity. Many Laws are made for the weal of the Kingdom, and to gratifie his Linnage, <hi>James</hi> the natural Son of <hi>James</hi> the fourth is created Earl of <hi>Murray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the preſence of this new Governour the face of the State turned more beautiful, and the Court more Royal, oppreſſion is reſtrained, juſtice ſincerely executed, the Court is frequented with good and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men, Malefactors and naughty perſons baniſh themſelves. He maketh a progreſs to all the notable Towns of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> ſeeing crimes puniſhed, and faults amended. Being a Stranger and not throughly acquainted with the municipal Statutes and particular practices of the Country, in matters great and of importance he proceedeth by the inſtructions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of ſome choice men of the Nation it ſelf. Eſpecially ſince he was not infinite to liſten to the advice of every one, he gave himſelf to hearken and follow the opinion and counſel of <hi>John Hepburn</hi> Prior of St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> whoſe judgment in his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulties he receives as an Oracle. This man being of a ſubtle mind, malitious, crafty, rich and endued with ſome Courtly eloquence, by a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Pretence of knowledge of the affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and State (neither in ſome things did he err) at firſt being very familiar with the Duke and in a little time after, by bribing ſecretly ſome of his choice Servants, turned his only Privado, and almoſt poſſeſſed alone his judgment and ear. He informed him of the ſtrength and Riches of the Country, of the nature of the people, manner of their Laws, revealed to him many ſecrets of the Government. He gave him a Catalogue of the whole deadly fewds and diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Noblemen and Gentry, opening unto him which were inveterate, and had long continued, and which were freſh, upon what accidents they had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:175204:150"/>
their beginnings. How in proſecuting Revenge in them they cared not how innocent any man was if he were of the Name and Alliance, but rather thought, the more innocent any was, the more it teſtified their ſpight, which they deſired to manifeſt by taking him away. He ſhewed him what factions were in the Kingdom, who ſway'd them, and were the heads. He told him the <hi>Scots</hi> were a violent fierce people, mutinouſly proud, and knew not how to obey with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sword were drawn. that they were never abſolutely governed by their own Kings themſelves, far leſs would they be ruled by him who was but a Governour, and half a Stranger. King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt they had killed, they had made a League againſt King <hi>James</hi> the Second, in open Battel they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown King <hi>James</hi> the Third, and the laſt King was by beſt judgments thought to have been ſecretly taken away: here (calling to mind the proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Arch-biſhop <hi>Andrew Formans</hi> Bull) he omitted nothing could derogate to the Chamberlains reputation and honour, and an evil opinion of him in the Governour.</p>
               <p>He inſtructed him how the great Houſes of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were ſo joined and linkt together, by kindred, Alliances, Bonds of ſervice or Homage, that no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of any quality, although a Malefactor and a guilty perſon, could be preſented to juſtice without ſome ſtir, commotion, tumult of the Grandees and their factious friends: Amidſt ſo many ſtrong parties and confederate male-contents, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the power of the <hi>Scots</hi> themſelves, and his own Kindred, Friends and Followers, were not powerful enough ſafely to adminiſter juſtice: for which cauſe the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould be implored to ſend hither competent forces to quell the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and ſhake the pride of the factious Nobles.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:175204:150"/>
The heads of the factions which had a principal ſway in the Kingdom at that time would either be cut off, or kept under, but with ſuch cunning and dexterity that it ſhould not be perceived, nor found out; that many were aimed at and intereſſed when ſome few did ſuffer and fall. That for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there were three heads to be looked unto as feared and like to bring Novations in the State, being men able to change the preſent Government.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> a man in the prime of his youth of high flying thoughts by his Alliance with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that eſtimation the people conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him by the demerits of his Anceſtors, and the ſingular love the Subjects bare him, carryed a mind above the fortune of a private man, and ſeemed not born to live a ſubjects life, each action of his bearing in it majeſty and magnificence, he had power to hurt if he would hurt.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chamberlain, a man unpoliſht, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly ſtout, hazardous, mighty in riches and power, and conſequently proud, of a working mind and vehement Spirit, whom time and experience had hardned by great exploits and moſt dangerous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who had the malice to be a Spectator of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfiture of his Prince and Countrymen at <hi>Flowden,</hi> was likely to attend the opportunity of traverſes and changes.</p>
               <p>The third was the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> once Secretary to the Pope, who though he was not of any Noble Stem nor deſcent of blood, nor for his Followers, Friends, and Adherents much to be taken notice of or feared, yet conſidering him as his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gateſhip, pluralty of benefices, many penſions from Princes, had guilded him over, and balancing him by his preſent treaſure, he could make a weak par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrong, and add weight to what ſide ſoever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:175204:151"/>
He was therefore with piercing eyes to be lookt into, and all his actions and ways to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>The Governour gave not great attention to what the Prior had inſtructed againſt the Arch-Biſhop, having before had ſome inkling of the rancor, gnudge and enmity between them. And he was conſcious the Arch-Biſhops riches were above envy; he hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ever more ſolicitous magnificently to ſpend what he had acquired than hoord up. Neither did he beſtow ſo much upon any of his Countrymen, as he did upon the <hi>French,</hi> the Friends and Servants of the Governour. He knew he was alſo ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as not to adhere to any of the factions of the time, in a neutrality indifferently and friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining all his Compatriots.</p>
               <p>Nor was he much moved at his information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> finding him a man peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, courteous to all and affable; and though of aſpiring thoughts, carryed often away with his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate delights and Courtly pleaſures.</p>
               <p>But what the Prior informed againſt the Lord Chamberlain he deeply ingraved in his memory, and ever after his countenance bewrayed certain flaws of ill concealed diſcontent: Neither did he thereafter ſhew him wonted favours, which the Chamberlain obſerving and gueſſing at the change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors mind towards him by more than ordinary evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and ſigns: He having been the only man who wrought his advancement and coming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> his deſerts new either forgot or ungratefully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, full of grief and diſdain, retired from the Court to his own Caſtles, where, when he had reſted a while, half aſtoniſhed to ſee his hopes ſo fruſtrate he taketh new reſolutions and determinations to play the Governour double or quite. Hereafter he leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no means untryed to become entire with the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:175204:151"/>
Queen and her Husband, and by obſervance and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent meeting with them, he wrought himſelf not only to be imbraced as their Friend, but their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor, and one in whom they had great confidence. He many times with them deplored the Publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, when his own particular only ſtung him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing himſelf of his too much forwardneſs in calling home a man born an Exile, whoſe Father died ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd for his ambition, and had eſſayed to take the Crown from his Eldeſt Brother. Sith this man was the neareſt of blood to ſucceed who could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his laſt work would be the making away the innocent Child, his Pupil, to aſcend the Royal Throne himſelf; in the height of Malice accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing what his Father out of a deſire to Rule did Project. By his tender years the King could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his danger, his Mother might anticipate it, that new neceſſities requir'd new remedies, only one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern gate remained yet open, which was, that the Queen would tranſport her Son to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this Plot was whiſper'd to the Governour, who wanted not his Emiſſaries among the Queens Attendants, it was no ſooner reveal'd than believ'd, and no ſooner believ'd, when (being a man who uſed celerity in all his Actions) with as many men as haſt could ſuffer him to gather, forthwith marched from <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> there unawares he ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Caſtle, and in it the Queen with her two Sons. A Council being aſſembled, the King with his Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> are ſequeſtred from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and truſted to the cuſtody of four Lords, who by turns interchangeably ſhould attend the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and have a care of their education. That no violence ſhould be offer'd them, certain Gentlemen of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> are appointed ſtill to wait on, nd guard them; from this ſuſpition the ſeeds of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:175204:152"/>
enmity began to be ſown between the Queen and the Governour, which neither time nor wiſdom thereafter could take away and root out.</p>
               <p>Amidſt this ſtorm of Court, the Lord Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain brought to a new traverſe of his thoughts, with his Brother Mr. <hi>William Hume</hi> fly towards <hi>England;</hi> the Queen with her Husband and Sir <hi>George Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs</hi> his Brother with an unexpected ſuddenneſs haſt to <hi>Tantallon,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Berwick,</hi> from which they had a convoy to the Nunnery of <hi>Colſtream:</hi> Here they attended advertiſement from the King of <hi>England</hi> what courſe to follow and know his pleaſure. He recommended them to the Protection and care of the Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> and aſſigned the Caſtle of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottle</hi> in <hi>Northumberland</hi> for his Siſters reſidence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her abode in theſe Northern parts, and the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour not a little perplexed at the flight and eſcape of thoſe Conſpiratours, ſendeth Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the Court of <hi>England</hi> to clear himſelf to the King of what might be ſurmiſed againſt him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe new ſtrangers come to his Country. He had done nothing which ſhould have offended the Queen, made her afraid, or to entertain or harbour a ſiniſter thought of his proceedings. Neither did he intend any thing againſt theſe had followed and accompanied her, which ſhould have moved them to leave their Country; unto whom if they pleaſed to return they ſhould be welcom, enjoy their wonted freedom, and keep peaceably what they had poſſeſſed. If they were conſcious to themſelves of any miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, he would not be too preciſe in the ſearch of it. He alſo trafficked by the friends of thoſe who favoured the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> and <hi>Humes</hi> to perſuade them to a Return, giving them fair Promiſes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what they ſhould demand. Till at laſt he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:175204:152"/>
removed them to bow and yield to his deſires. The fugitive Gentlemen return'd; but the Queen being with child, and near the time of her delivery, was neceſſitated to ſtay ſtill, till at <hi>Harbottle</hi> Caſtle ſhe brought forth her daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> after Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>Britain.</hi> So ſoon as ſhe was able to endure travel, and be tranſported, King <hi>Henry</hi> with an honourable retinue brought her to his Court, where ſhe was by him and his Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> (late Queen of <hi>France</hi>) welcomed. In <hi>May</hi> ſhe made her progreſs through <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Baynards</hi> Caſtle, and from thence to <hi>Greenwich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Contrivers of the exploit of tranſporting the King to <hi>England</hi> being within the Country, and, as it were, ſecure, the Governor, whoſe head was filled with ſuſpitions, not thinking himſelf bound by promiſes, will have them give a reckoning of their enterprize and flight into <hi>England.</hi> Againſt ſome he hath clear proofs, fair and manifeſt evidences, againſt other bare ſurmiſes and naked ſuſpitions; for they had not left the Country, nor had they been partakers of the Queens fortunes. Here with an unexpected ſuddenneſs, Mr. <hi>Gavin Dowglas</hi> Uncle to the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dunkel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick Panther</hi> Secretary to the late King, were committed. Mr. <hi>Gavin</hi> in the Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in <hi>Garvet</hi> Caſtle. The Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> grand-Father to the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> having beaten a Lyon Herauld, who too imperiouſly had given a charge to anſwer to ſuch things ſhould be objected againſt him, was impriſoned in the Caſtle of <hi>Blackneſs. Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Hume</hi> being charged to anſwer for his actions and proceedings, and not appearing, was denounced Rebel, his moveables ſeiſed on and brought to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, Stir'd up and irritated by this outrage, he maketh Roads upon the neighbour bounds, plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

                  <hi>Dumbar</hi> which was the Governors chief reſort and to revenge his wrongs, ſetteth on work the Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers on the borders. To repreſs and bridle this ravag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Governor in perſon with a thouſand hardy Souldiers marcheth to the Borders, directeth ſome companies to find out the Lord <hi>Hume;</hi> but he, either diſmaid at the worth and fortune of the Governor, or broken and bowing under the burthen of his own miſeries, cometh to the Governor and ſubmitted his life and eſtate to his faith and clemency: brought to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> he is truſted to the cuſtody of <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> the Husband of his Siſter, with threatnings under pain of high Treaſon, that he ſhould not part with him, nor ſuffer him to eſcape. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> had not long ſtaid in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> when with gloſſes of probalities of changes caſual, and ſuch as might fall forth, he mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> to be of his Mind, and brought him to conſpire againſt the Governor, and hazard to put himſelf in his place of State. He himſelf was the only man who had brought in the Governor, and he knew well how to put him out, if the Earl would be of the Party, and by his negligence not reject a Supream honor thrown in his arms. He is begun already not to be lov'd, if he was not already hated by the Subjects by his imperious proceedings. If the King of <hi>England</hi> could find ſome few Noblemen to make head againſt him, he would conſtrain him to leave the Country. The Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was neereſt heir to the King, it was more reaſon he ſhould be ſecond in the Kingdom than <hi>John,</hi> who though deſcended of a brother, yet a baniſht man, and a ſtranger to the <hi>Scots</hi> Nation, with whom had they not ſo much as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and familiarity of language. After many ſuch like inducements, the Priſoner took away his Keeper with him to the South parts of the Country:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:175204:153"/>
and both by Letters to their Familiars, Kindred, and acquaintance, and private meetings with other Noble men ſtrove to make ſtrong and increaſe their faction.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Spring <hi>John Stuart</hi> Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Siſters ſon of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf in the Party of the Conſpiring Lords, and with a number of his Friends and Followers inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Caſtle of <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> which if they could have kept, had been a great advancement to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the Governour gathering an Army of as many as haſt would ſuffer him to Aſſemble, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders not being ſtrong enough to reſiſt him, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Caſtle with ſmall loſs of his men. After which in indignation he marched to throw down the Caſtle of <hi>Hamilton;</hi> here victorious anger was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by pity and compaſſion: for the old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of <hi>Arran</hi> being at that time there reſident (who was Daughter to King <hi>James</hi> the Second, Siſter to King <hi>James</hi> the Third, Mother to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> Gandmother to the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Aunt to the Governour) a Lady venerable for years and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, with tears of affection and ſorrow falling down at the Governours feet, and received by him with great commiſeration in a merciful manner, not only preſerv'd the Caſtle, but by the means of the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Andrew Forman,</hi> entred into a Treaty for Peace to her Son, and the Earl of <hi>Lennox.</hi> And in <hi>November</hi> the two Earls coming to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> by the means of this <hi>Arch-biſhop</hi> were reconciled with the Governor. About this time (his Mother being far from him to diſcharge the laſt duties of affection towards him) <hi>Alexander</hi> Duke of <hi>Rothſay,</hi> Brother to the King, a Child to admiration beautiful and Delightful, died at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and was buried in the Abby Church of <hi>Cambuskenneth.</hi>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:175204:154"/>
almoſt expir'd, and both having a deſire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſent their Commiſſioners to <hi>Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> to whom the Duke, then reſident at <hi>Dumbar,</hi> ſent <hi>Monſieur du Plains</hi> Embaſſador for the <hi>French</hi> King, Sir <hi>William Scot</hi> of <hi>Balweary,</hi> and <hi>Gavin Dumbar</hi> Arch-Dean of Saint <hi>Andrews.</hi> Theſe after ſome altercation concerning the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Fugitives, conclude a Peace between the Nations from the midſt of <hi>January</hi> till the feaſt of <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> after. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> comprehended in the Articles the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs,</hi> the Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> and the reſt of the Queens ſtrayed Faction, with all their Kinſmen, Clients and Followers. The Lord <hi>Hume</hi> was received again into the Governours favor, with condition that if he after break his promiſes and oaths, his old faults ſhould be remembered and joined to his new. Maſter <hi>Gavin Dowglaſs</hi> and Mr. <hi>Patrick Panther</hi> were ſet at Liberty, The Lord <hi>Drummond</hi> who had been forfeited was again reſtored, the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> with theſe who had followed him with many ceremonies, and great ſtore of Friendſhip, was welcomed again to the Court.</p>
               <p>The Diſorders of the Kingdom called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which many acts were made to reſtrain and keep under bold and wicked men, and preſerve the peace of the Kingdom. In this Parliament it was Ordained, the Kings Brother <hi>Alexander</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, that the Governour ſhould be reputed ſecond Perſon of the Realm, and next heir to the Crown. Notwithſtanding of the claim made by <hi>Alexander Stuart</hi> the elder brother of the Governour, who was begotten on a Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Orkenay,</hi> to whom the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> their Father had been lawfully joined in marriage before his coming to <hi>France,</hi> and thus before the marrying of the Earl of <hi>Bulloignes</hi> daughter the Mother of <hi>John</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, upon which ground <hi>Alexander</hi> had great
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:175204:154"/>
reaſon to make his claim and proteſtation as heir to his Father. Notwithſtanding of his challenge and bravado, <hi>Alexander</hi> being more fit for a Cowl than a Crown, in open Parliament gave over all Title he had to the Crown in his brothers favour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to deprive him ever hereafter of lawfull Succeſſion, they turned him Prieſt, being made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Murray</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Skoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A truce being ſincerely kept with <hi>England</hi> tumults within the Country appeaſed particular deadly fewds and jarres of private perſons either curbed or ſmothered up, the Governour giveth himſelf ſome weeks to his Courtly recreations at <hi>Faulk-land,</hi> with what paſtime ſoever he be delighted, or beguile the hours all the day long, in the night he is often haunted by his old familiar the Prior of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> whom ambition, ſpight, malice never ſuffered to take any reſt.</p>
               <p>This man put in the Governors head and made him believe, that his endeavours and pains heretofore would prove but vain in ſettling the Government, and that the peace of the Kingdom ſhould never be laſting, firm and permanent, if ſo dangerous a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as the Lord Chamberlain remained alive; whom neither rewards could ſoften, nor honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment oblige and make conſtant. How many times had he been pardoned? How often and without a cauſe had he returned again to his former Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies? Should the Governour of his own free-will or of neceſſity be moved to return to <hi>France,</hi> what would not the boldneſs of this man attempt in his abſence, which his authority and preſence could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver curb and keep within compaſs? the life of this man would be the death and total ruine of the Peace, of the concord and harmony of the State, bring forth nothing but dangerous and wicked effects; the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:175204:155"/>
of ambition having pulled him from his own judgment. Should he be challenged and put to a tryal of his Peers. He could not ſhun the blow of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the cry of his oppreſſion and wrongs having reached heaven: A member ſo often in vain cured and ſtill gangrened ſhould be cut off.</p>
               <p>The Governour, whoſe Brains the Prior had now embrued with jealouſies, thought it no great matter upon the informations he had received to put the Chamberlain to a Tryal; for if he proved not guilty it would be but to leave him in that ſtate and caſe he was found in; and calumnies though they do not born yet black. Being come to <hi>Edenburgh</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a convention of the Nobility, all which time he earneſtly trafficked with the Friends of the Lord Chamberlain that he ſhould not be abſent, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be determined in Council concerning him nearly, and he had need of his advice and council.</p>
               <p>The Court and City being full of whiſperings and expectation of ſome ſudden change, many diſſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Chamberlain from appearing; if he appeared, that he would leave his Brother Maſter <hi>William</hi> (a man equal in judgment and courage to himſelf) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. He, trained into falſe hopes by the blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Governour towards his friends, and inveigled by preſumption, with his Brother, and (Sir <hi>Andrew</hi> called by the Country Lord) <hi>David Car</hi> of <hi>Farnehaſt</hi> cometh to Court, where they were with many ceremonies welcomed by the Governour, with more than ordinary favours entertained, and ſhortly after all three impriſoned, produced in judgment to anſwer to ſuch things as ſhould be objected againſt them according to the Laws of the Kingdom, and ſubmitted to the Sentence of a Jury. No new crime was laid to their charge, <hi>James</hi> Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> the natural Son of the late King, accuſed the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:175204:155"/>
of the death of his Father: who by many wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes was proved alive, and ſeen to come from the Battel of <hi>Flowden:</hi> This by pregnant evidences not being proved, he was indicted of divers other points of Treaſon, and his private faults are found out and laid againſt him: they renew the memory of the late ſtirs of State and theſe diſorders, of which he was either the Author or acceſſary to them. He had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and maintained the Factions, Thefts and Robberies of wicked Malefactors on the Borders: he had not honourably nor honeſtly carryed himſelf at the Battel of <hi>Flowden,</hi> performing neither the duty of a Soldier nor Commander. He had ſuffered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to repair and of new fortifie the Caſtle of <hi>Norham,</hi> which without either trouble to himſelf or danger to his Friends, he might have hindred. Of every of which points and particularities he not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifying himſelf, the Judges prepared and directed by the Governor (whom they record to have given information of a hainous crime committed by the Chamberlain and his brother, for the odiouſneſs of it not to be revealed to the people) pronounce him and his Brother guilty, and condemn them to have their Heads cut off. The day following the ſentence was put in execution, and their heads fixt on the moſt eminent part of the Town of <hi>Edenburgh. David Car</hi> of <hi>Farnhaſt,</hi> either by the Jury, being declared not guilty (as ſome have recorded) or by the Corrupting of his Keepers (as others) or by the permiſſion of the Governor, eſcap'd this danger; which brought the People to believe the Chamberlain was by his means entrapped, <hi>To ſink, whom he put himſelf in hazard of drowning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Calamity of the family of the <hi>Humes,</hi> being ſo ancient, potent and couragious, bred terrour and aſtoniſhmenr in many of the other Noblemen of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:175204:156"/>
Kingdom, and eſtranged their Hearts form the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; his ears began to be after attentive to every rumour, and his eyes pryed into each accident; at laſt, as if he were wearied with wreſtling with the many diſorders, and cumberſome Factions of the Country, he ſought how by ſome fair way he might for a while return to <hi>France.</hi> Embaſſadours being ſent from King <hi>Francis</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> to renew the ancient League between the two Nations, when the Nobles aſſembled to make choice of the man on whom they ſhould transfer the honour of the accompliſhment of ſo ſolemn an action and paſs to <hi>France,</hi> the Governour carryed the matter ſo by means of the <hi>French,</hi> that it was conferred on himſelf, but with this condition (to entertain them with hopes of his Return) that he ſhould not ſtay above ſix Months out of the Country; Having obtained this privileged abſence of them, his next care was to preſerve the State from any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations till his Return, and to find the Government as he left it. Hereupon to preſerve the Perſon of the King, he is conveyed from <hi>Sterlin</hi> to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and truſted to the cuſtody of the Earl of <hi>Marſhall,</hi> the Lords <hi>Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Borthick,</hi> two of which ſhould be always reſident with him, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company and aſſiſt the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> his conſtant and unremovable Guardian. For the Government of the State he leaveth ſeven Deputies in his Place, The Earl of <hi>Arran, Anguſs, Huntley, Arguile,</hi> the Arch-Biſhops of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> to theſe is adjoined Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey le Sieur de la Beautie,</hi> whom he had made Captain of <hi>Dumbar,</hi> and promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in the Lord <hi>Humes</hi> Place, Warden of the Eaſt Marches, keeping the days of Truce and Juſtice Courts. This was the man to whom the entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of all the Governours affairs was intruſted, and who ſhould give him advertiſment of what did paſs
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:175204:156"/>
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> during his aboed in <hi>France.</hi> That no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſhould ariſe amongſt men equal in places and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority (the ordinary occaſion of diviſion) ſeveral ſhires which they ſhould govern to every one of them are allotted. To Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey</hi> was deſtinated the Government of the <hi>Merſs</hi> and <hi>Lothian;</hi> to the other their ſhires were appointed as the convenience of their dwelling places, Friends and Kindred did afford them. Under pretexts and fair colours of honour, and as to paſs the time, and be trained in <hi>French</hi> Civility, alſo for the greater magnificency, the Governour took in his company the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> the Lord <hi>Gordon,</hi> Maſters of <hi>Glencarn</hi> and <hi>Arran,</hi> other young Lords; who in effect were ſo many Hoſtages, that no ſtir by their Parents, Kindred, Friends, ſhould be raiſed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his abſence. He likewiſe under dark Shadows and far ſought pretences committed to ſuch Caſtles as were garriſoned with <hi>French</hi> Soldiers, as <hi>Dumbarton, Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, Garvet,</hi> certain Barons of the South and Weſt Countries, who wanted nothing but liberty, not for any thing they had done, but what they might do the Governour being out of the Kingdom. Matters brought to ſuch a paſs as his beſt Politicians could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, accompanied with Maſter <hi>Gavin Dowglaſs</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Dunkell,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Patrick Panther</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the late King, men whom he feared to leave behind him, and entertained (though he knew they loved him not) as his boſom friends, in <hi>June</hi> at <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartoun</hi> he took Shipping.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> after ſhe had remained a year in <hi>England</hi> underſtanding by Letters the Governour had taken the Seas, and was on his way towards <hi>France,</hi> honourably diſmiſſed by her Brother came to <hi>Scotland</hi> At <hi>Berwick</hi> ſhe was received by her Husband the Earl of <hi>Anguſs;</hi> but he was not accepted with the favours he was wont; for that plague of too much love
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:175204:157"/>
(jealouſie) had infected her, having gotten ſome inkling that he delighted in a free bed, and during the time of her abode in <hi>England</hi> had entertained a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in <hi>Dowglaſs</hi>-dale, an injury beyond degree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, after which ſhe began to diſdain him, and ſeek how ſhe might be divorced from him. <hi>Though whilſt the King was kept in the Caſtle of</hi> Edenburgh <hi>all acceſs unto him was refuſed her, when he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the Caſtle of</hi> Craigmillar, <hi>out of a ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rumour the Plague had infected</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>by the courteſie of the Lord</hi> Areskin, <hi>ſhe had liberty to viſit him, But her frequent haunting him out of too much motherly kindneſs, breeding a ſuſpition in his Guardians, that, as had once before been practiſed. by a Queen in</hi> Scotland, <hi>She had an intention to have ſtoln him away and ſent him to his Uncle, reſtrained her long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acceſs to him, and procured his return back again to the Caſtle of</hi> Edenburgh.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey</hi> having by his vigilancy, pains, courage, given many proofs of his worth in defence of the Borders, and adminiſtration of Juſtice in thoſe ſhires he governed; The other Governours, often diſagreeing amongſt themſelves, either out of Love of reſt, and to be vacant from buſineſs, or out of malice to procure him greater hatred, declare him abſolute Deputy: and they gave their promiſes to ſecond him in way of Juſtice: and here he found the difference between extreams and mediocrities. Many diſdained a Stranger ſhould be in that place, ſo many brave men of their Nation neglected. A quarrel at that time, either true and real, or (as others have recorded) altogether forged and contriv'd to draw the Deputy in a Danger, ariſing between the Stewards of the Laird of <hi>Langtoun,</hi> and one of his Uncles, who by the power and means of Sir <hi>David Hume</hi> of <hi>Wedderburn,</hi> whoſe Siſter was his wife, had thruſt out and ejected
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:175204:157"/>
the young heir and them, of their own Caſtle of <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi> and kept it by force. The Deputy accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with certain Lords of the Borders, and ſome <hi>French</hi> men his own Domeſticks came to the Town of <hi>Dunce,</hi> to hold a Juſtice Court concerning this Riot. The <hi>Humes,</hi> who thought nothing juſter than revenge, nor nobler than the effects of anger, having ſworn a requital of their Chiefs wrong, and to pay the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour home when occaſion ſhould be offered, by the counſel and forwardneſs of Sir <hi>David Hume,</hi> lay an ambuſh, and lie in wait for the Deputy; the Plot not failing, they invade him at ſuch a diſadvantage, that ſome of his Servants killed, he was conſtrained to ſeek an eſcape by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe, who in the chaſe either falling or ſinking in a mariſh, left his Maſter to the cruelty of his Purſuers, who ſtrook of his head, and to feed their eyes with the ſpectacle of their rage, ſet it to the diſgrace of the <hi>French</hi> on the battlements of the Caſtle of <hi>Hume.</hi> This end had Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey</hi> who deſerved ſo well both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> having been cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, valiant, and noble in all his actions, and a great Adminiſtrator of Juſtice, who ſpared no travel, and freely adventured upon any dangers to ſuppreſs malefactors, and defend the weak and innocent.</p>
               <p>The Governours, That greater miſchief ſhould not follow the boldneſs of theſe men, made choice of the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> to reſiſt their outrage, and declare him Warden of the Marches and Supream. Which election diſpleaſed the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> armed with power, neglecting <hi>Anguſs</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, immediately committed Sir <hi>George Dowglas</hi> his Brother to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and <hi>Mark Car</hi> in <hi>Garvet</hi> Caſtle, out of a ſuſpition they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to the ſlaughter of Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey.</hi> In a Parliament ſhortly following many of the <hi>Humes

and Cockburns</hi> Fugitives for this ſlaughter, and for that they had invited the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their aid and ſpoil of the Country, are declared Rebels. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being diſſolved, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of Soldiers, and ſome great Ordinance, beſieged the Caſtles of <hi>Hume</hi> and <hi>Langtoun,</hi> and had h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the accident or Sir <hi>Anthony Darcey</hi> was noiſed at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to have ſaid he never looked for better at the hands of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> ſhould have deputed men of their own nation to have governed them, and not a ſtranger, being a people delighting in Miſgovernment, ever well pleaſed at the Falls and tragical ends of their Rulers, and joying to ſee any hard hap happen to them they deem happy.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Dunkell</hi> who had accompanied the Governour to <hi>France,</hi> uſed ſuch diligence at the Court, that he was imployed to be the firſt Meſſenger to the Country of the great promiſes and many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>French,</hi> at the confirmation of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, with their proteſtations for the preſerving and maintaining the Liberties of the Kingdom of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> againſt all who would eſſay to empair them. Not long after arrived the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> and an Herauld with Letters from King <hi>Francis</hi> and the Governour, amplifying and putting a larger gloſs on the ſame. But when by other Letters the Queen and Nobles had received certain intelligence that King <hi>Francis</hi> and the King of <hi>England</hi> had compoſed their Quarrels, entred in a new band of Amity a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive League being paſſed between them, <hi>Tournay</hi> rendred to the <hi>French,</hi> promiſes upon either ſide ſolemnly made for a Match to be between the Daul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phine of <hi>France,</hi> eldeſt ſon to King <hi>Francis,</hi> and the eldeſt daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England.</hi> when
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:175204:158"/>
age ſhould enable them for marriage; and that in the large Treaty of Peace, not one word was ſet down for the quietneſs and help of thoſe who for the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of <hi>France</hi> haſt loſt their King, and endangered their whole Kingdom; no care had of their welfare and proſperity, they ſtormed not a little, and thought their lives and travels evil imployed. Then with as great haſt as ſuch a matter required they diſpatched Letters back again to the Governour blotted with complaints and expoſtulations. The year following to excuſe his overſight, the <hi>French</hi> King ſent a <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> why he had not made mention of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his league with <hi>England,</hi> He had ſtudied to give ſatisfaction to ſome of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility (obliquely touching the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi>) whoſe minds he knew to be altogether averſe from any peace or Truce with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation; whoſe undaunted Spirits and great courages were only bent to revenge the deaths of their King, Kinſmen and Compations. This evaſion not giving ſatisfaction to the beſt adviſed of the Council, the <hi>French</hi> King interpoſed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with King <hi>Henry</hi> to have a ceſſation of arms for as ſhort a time as he could deviſe. Whereupon <hi>Clarencieux</hi> and one <hi>la Fiot,</hi> coming to <hi>Scotland,</hi> the one from the King of <hi>England,</hi> the other from the <hi>French</hi> King, a Truce was concluded between the two Kingdoms for one year and a whole day: The reaſon of this Truce was thought moſtly to be, for that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the next Summer, were to have an interview, and with all Princely courteſies entertain each other.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom began to be ſenſible of the abſence of the Governour, factions increaſing, the Commons ſuffering dayly outrages, the Nobility and Gentry deciding their Rights by their Swords. The Earl of <hi>Rothſay</hi> and the Lord <hi>Lindſay</hi> contending which

All that he propounded being rejected by implacable men, and finding the only way to be freed of violence, to be violent, and that danger could not be avoyded but by a greater danger, with an hundred hardy reſolute men armed with long Spears and Pikes, which the Citizens as he traverſed the Streats, out of Windows furniſhed him, he inveſted a part of the Town, and barricadoed ſome Lanes with Carts and other impediments which the time did affrad. The adverſe party truſting to their number, and the ſupply of the Citizens (who calling to mind the ſlaughter of their Deacon, ſhew them ſmall favour,) diſdaining the Earl ſhould thus muſter on the Streats, in great fury invade him.

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> having angled the Peoples hearts by his Magnificence, Wiſdom, Courage and Liberality, his Faction began to bear greateſt ſway in the Kingdom.

Mr. <hi>Gavin Dowglaſs</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dunkell,</hi> in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Nephew, finding the Governour violent in the Chaſe of the Faction of the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> fled privately to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> where he gave informations to King <hi>Henry</hi> againſt him. <hi>He alone had taken to him the cuſtody of the young King, the ſequel whereof he much feared; he was an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Enemy to the whole Family of the</hi> Dowglaſſes <hi>The principal cauſe of his coming to</hi> Scotland <hi>was to engage the Nation in a War againſt</hi> England, <hi>that the</hi> Engliſh <hi>ſhould not aſſiſt the Emperour againſt the</hi> French <hi>King, and make his Nation ſlaves to</hi> France.</p>
               <p>This Biſhop ſhortly after dyed at <hi>London,</hi> and was buried in the <hi>Savoy</hi> Church: having been a man Noble, Valiant, Learned, and an excellent Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, as his Works, yet extant, teſtifie.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> upon ſuch informations ſent <hi>Clarencieux</hi> (King of Arms) to <hi>Scotland</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Duke to avoid the Country, according to the Articles agreed upon between the <hi>French</hi> King and him in their laſt Truce.</p>

                  <hi>It belonged</hi> (ſaid Clarencieux) <hi>to his Maſter to tender the life, wellfare, honour, fortunes of his Nephew, of none of which he could be aſſured ſo long as the Duke ruled and ſtayed in</hi> Scotland. <hi>It was againſt all reaſon, and unbeſeeming, the man ſhould be ſole Guardian to a King, who was the next heir to the Crown: how eaſily might he be tempted by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to commit the like unnatural cruelty which ſome have done in the like caſe both in</hi> England <hi>and other parts of</hi> Europe? <hi>if he loved his Nation and Prince (as he gave out) he required him to leave the Country, which if he yield not unto, but obſtinately continued in a reſolution to ſtay, he denounced from his Maſter preſent war.</hi> He farther complained, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Anguſs, <hi>who was King</hi> Henries <hi>Brother-in-Law, was by him baniſht and detained in</hi> France; <hi>That during the baniſhment of the Earl, which had been near a whole year, the Duke had importuned his Siſter the Queen with diſhoneſt love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour anſwered <hi>Clarencieux, That what the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> England <hi>agreed upon in their Treaties of Peace was to him uncertain, but of this he was moſt certain, That neither the King of</hi> England <hi>nor</hi> France <hi>had power to baniſht him (a Foreiner over whom their authority did not reach) his native Country, like, over like having no juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As concerning the King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>who was yet young in years he reverenced him as his Soveraign Lord, and would keep and defend both him and his Kingdom according to his Conſcience, honour, and bound duty; that there were ever more men in the world who deſired to be Kings, than there were King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to be beſtowed upon them, of which number he was none, having ever preferred a mean eſtate juſtly enjoyed, before a Kingdom evil acquired. For the Earl of</hi> Anguſs, <hi>he had uſed all Courteſies towards
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:175204:162"/>
him notwithſtanding of his evil demerits, not for his own ſake (he did confeſs) but for the Queens ſake, whom he honoured find reſpected as the Mother of his Prince, and towards whom he ſhould continue his Obſervance. That the King of</hi> England <hi>needed not miſdoubt he would attempt any thing, ſhould dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the honour of his Siſter, that complements of meer courteſie in</hi> France, <hi>might be ſurmiſed ſometimes by</hi> Engliſh <hi>Ladies to be ſolicitations and ſuits of Love.</hi>

                  <hi>For the War, with which in caſe of his ſtay, he threatned his nation, he would uſe his beſt endeavours to ſet his in a poſture of Defence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When this anſwer was reported to King <hi>Henry,</hi> he gathered a great Army to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> and eſſay if by their own dangers the <hi>Scots</hi> people could be moved to abandon and diſclaim the Dukes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Seven great Ships came to <hi>Inche-keeth</hi> and ſpoiled the adjacent Coaſts: all the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi> which did them inhabite <hi>London,</hi> and other places of <hi>England,</hi> were put ot their fines, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go off the Country.</p>
               <p>In compenſation and for equal amends, the <hi>French</hi> Kingſeized all <hi>Engliſh</hi> mens goods in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned the perſons, and retained the money to be paid for the reſtitution of <hi>Tournay</hi> The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> making incurſions on the Borders, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the one half of <hi>Kelſo,</hi> and plundered the other.</p>
               <p>At this time the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth came to <hi>England,</hi> and ſtirred King <hi>Henry</hi> to take arms againſt the <hi>French</hi> King; and the <hi>French</hi> had ſent Embaſſadours to <hi>Scotland</hi> intreating and conjuring the <hi>Scots</hi> by their old and new League to ariſe in arms and invade <hi>England.</hi> The Governour aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the three Eſtates at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which together condeſcended to the raiſing of an Army to reſiſt the incurſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and defend the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:175204:162"/>
to encourage every man for fighting, the Wards of thoſe which ſhould fall in this expedition, were freely remitted and diſcharged by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and penſions deſigned to the Widdows and Daughters of thoſe who dyed in this ſervice. This Empyrick balm could the <hi>French</hi> apply to cure the wounds of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> advancing (as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) towards the weſt Borders, an Army was far gathered and encamped on <hi>Roſline-moor,</hi> which after, according to the orders given, marched to <hi>Annandale</hi> and forwards, came to the <hi>Esk,</hi> a River running in the Iriſh Seas neer <hi>Carlile;</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour delighted with the Seat and ſtanding of the place, cauſed dig Trenches, and by the advice of certain <hi>French</hi> Gunners placed ſome Field Pieces, and ſmall Ordinance for defence of them, and ſpread there his Pavilions. The Citizens of <hi>Carlile</hi> terrified at the ſudden approach of ſo powerful an Army, offer many preſents for the ſatety of their Towns which he rejected. The Engliſh Army not minding to invade the Scots ſo long as they kept themſelves on their own ground and advanced not, the Governour endeavoured to make the <hi>Scots</hi> ſpoil the Country by incurſions, but he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them ſlack and unwilling to obey and follow him, moſt part refuſing to go upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ground, amongſt whom <hi>Alexander</hi> Lord <hi>Gordon</hi> was the chief and firſt man. The Governour finding his command neglected, and ſome Noble men diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what he moſt intended, cometh back to the place where they made their ſtand, and deſires a reaſon of their ſtay. They told him, they had determined to defend their own Country, not invade <hi>England.</hi> That it neither conſiſted with the weal of the Commonwealth, nor as matters went at that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:175204:163"/>
time, had they ſufficient forces to make invaſive War That the Governour did not inſtigate them to invade <hi>England</hi> for the love he carryed to <hi>Scotland,</hi> but for a benefit to the <hi>French,</hi> by invading they might make themſelves a prey to their enemies; they were Men and not Angels; it was enough for them whilſt their King was under age to defend his Kingdom from the violence of Foreigners. Put the caſe they were in one battel victorious, conſidering the ſlaughter and loſs of their Nobles and Gentry in that purchaſe, they might be overthrown in a ſecond fight, and then to what would the King and Country be reduced? their laſt King might ſerve them for a pattern, the Revenge of whoſe death ſhould be delayed till he himſelf were of years to undertake it.</p>
               <p>The Governour brought to an exigent, ſaid they ſhould have propounded theſe difficulties before they took Arms, and not on the place of Battel. Teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity misbecame Noblemen in action, but eſpecially in matters of War, in which a man cannot err twice. At the convention of the three Eſtates when war was in deliberation, they ſhould have inquired for the cauſes of it; he was not to bring them upon the danger of a war without their own conſent. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had made many incurſions, upon their Country, burning and ravaging: who ſtand only upon defence, ſtand upon no defence; a better defence of their own Country could not be found than by invading the Country of their Enemies. They ſhould not be dejected for that accident at <hi>Flowden,</hi> ſince it was not the fault of the Souldier, but the Treaſon of their Chamberlain who had ſuffered for it. That the glory of the Nation ſhould raiſe their courages, and inflame their boſoms with a deſire of revenge: The Kings honour and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:175204:163"/>
their piety towards the Ghoſts of their Compatriots, craved no leſs from them. That if they would not invade <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt, for their Reputation and Fame with the World, they would pitch there a ſhort time their Tents, and try if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would hazard to aſſail them. That it would be an everlaſting branding their honour, if timorouſly in a ſuddenneſs they ſhow their backs to their enemies, and dared them not in the face by ſome daies ſtay.</p>
               <p>The Queen, though abſent, had thus perſuaded the Noblemen, and having underſtood the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be turned now flexible, ſhe diſpatched a Poſt to him, requeſting he would be pleaſed with a Truce for ſome Months, and that he would commune with the Warden of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marches, whom ſhe ſhould move to come to his Tent and treat with him. The Governour finding he ſtood not well aſſured of ſome of his Army, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a cumberſome task it was to withſtand the the violence of their deſires, determined to follow their own current: ſeemed well pleaſed to hearken to their opinion. Hereupon the Lord <hi>Dacres</hi> War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Weſt Marches came unto the Governours Camp the eleventh of <hi>September</hi> (and as ſome have recorded, the Queen alſo) where a Ceſſation of Arms was agreed unto for ſome daies, in which time the Queen and the Governour ſhould ſend Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to treat for a Peace with King <hi>Henry,</hi> and ſhortly after, Embaſſadours were directed to the Court of <hi>England,</hi> but returned without any good done, King <hi>Henry</hi> demanding extraordinary and harmful conditions to the Realm of <hi>Scotland.</hi>

               <p>The year 1522. <hi>Andrew Forman</hi> Arch-Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> dyed, and <hi>James Beatoun</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> and <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the Kingdom

came in his place of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the ArchBiſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of <hi>Glaſgow</hi> was conferred upon <hi>Gavin Dumbar</hi> whom the King after advanced to be Chancellor of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Governour reſenting highly the ſlighting of the Embaſſadours by the King of <hi>England,</hi> but more the contempt and ſcorn of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nobility in refuſing to follow him, in <hi>October</hi> by the Weſt Seas paſt over to <hi>France,</hi> promiſing that if a peace in this mean time were not concluded with <hi>England,</hi> he would the next Summer bring ſuch War-like Briggades of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> that he ſhould not ſtand much in need of his own Countrymen, who had continued ſo refractory and backward to his deſigns. He demanded from King <hi>Francis</hi> five thouſand <hi>German</hi> Horſemen, and ten thouſand foot to be tranſported to <hi>Scotland:</hi> which with the <hi>Scots</hi> who would accompany him, he thought ſufficient to continue a War with <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> could not ſpare ſo many men, having Wars both with the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but they gave him three thouſand Pikes, and one thouſand Launces. The Governour intending to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> receiving intelligence that the Ports towards the coaſts of <hi>France</hi> were watched by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to intrap him in his paſſage, beſtowed his Ships ſo covertly here and there in ſmall companies to avoid all ſuſpition of any purpoſe he had to ſtir that year, as that thereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Sir <hi>William Fitz-Williams,</hi> which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and waited his coming forth, until the Midſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> brake up &amp; beſtowed themſelves in convenient Ports againſt the next ſpring. The Duke then watching opportunity, and readily gathering together his diſperſed Ships, to the number of ſome fifty Sail, imbarked his men at <hi>Breſt</hi> in <hi>Bretaign</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:175204:164"/>
the one and twenty of <hi>September,</hi> and landed at <hi>Kirkowbry,</hi> or the Iſle of <hi>Arran,</hi> in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland.</hi> In his company was <hi>Richard de la Pool</hi> who had been baniſhed <hi>England,</hi> and to his power faithfully aſſiſted the Governour. He arrived the ſame time that <hi>Jedbrough</hi> was burnt by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> high Admiral of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and his Brother, with a competent power entring <hi>Scotland</hi> had burnt many Towns, and overthrown Caſtles and Piles.</p>
               <p>At his coming the Duke aſſembled the Lords at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> where they agreed that an Army ſhould forthwith be gathered, and the 28. of <hi>October</hi> was appointed for their meeting at <hi>Dowglaſs-dale.</hi> At the day prefixt the Army marched towards <hi>Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtream</hi> upon the <hi>Tweed.</hi> Out of this Army the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour having ſelected a number of the hardieſt Souldiers of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and convoying ſome Artillery over the water under the command of <hi>David Car</hi> of <hi>Farnehaſt,</hi> on the laſt of <hi>October</hi> they beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Wark,</hi> which was defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Edward Lile</hi> or <hi>Liſle.</hi> The Aſſailants upon the outmoſt Ward continuing their Battery, entred by main force the ſecond Ward, but being there repulſed and beaten back, a great Tempeſt ariſing, and fearing the ſwelling of the River of <hi>Tweed</hi> might cut them off from their Army on the other ſide, they turned back and repaſſed the Water; the Report of the Earl of <hi>Surreys</hi> forces come to reſcue the Caſtle and lying <hi>Anwick,</hi> had alſo perplexed them not a little; the Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> at his approach finding the Enemy retired to the other ſide of the River, the Caſtle ſafe, and having no Commiſſion to paſs the <hi>Engliſh</hi> marches, or to invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> made no further purſuit. In the mean time the Queen who had ever ſought to make firm friendſhip

Whereunto the King conſenting, the Governour finding the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords averſe to his intentions, that he was this time ſerved as he had been before (they refuſing ſtill to enter upon <hi>England</hi>) and that ſtriving would but the more chafe them, alſo condeſcended. Thus a Truce was promiſed, and faithful peace concluded till the laſt of <hi>November,</hi> being the Feaſt of <hi>St. Andrews;</hi> the Winter paſt without any invaſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on <hi>Scotland,</hi> or the <hi>Scots</hi> on <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of this Truce many ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations were amongſt the Lords of <hi>Scotland</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were more fit to continue this War, or give it over. Many of them held it unreaſonable that for the only pleaſure of the <hi>French</hi> King the Realm of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould ſuffer any more damage by the Contiuning of ſo needleſs a War, and that the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> was alwaies ſet to perform what the <hi>French</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not what was expedient for the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, nor what was in their poſſibility to accompliſh. Wherefore they wiſhed that their young King now having attained ſome years of diſcretion, and paſſing the age of a Child, might bear ſome ſway in the Government of the Realm. Some argued that a King ſooner than the Sons of Noblemen went out of the bondage of Tutelage, and enjoyed greater immunities, his age often being reckoned from the time of his conception. That the adminiſtration and charge of the Kingdom ſhould early be given him, that he might with his years grow in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:175204:165"/>
could not by the weakneſs of his judgment diſcern Right from Wrong, the Helm of State ſhould not be truſted, and that the Peers of the Kingdom might be challeng'd of dotage by their Neighbor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys for giving to a Child the Sword of Juſtice, which he might thruſt in their own entrails one day or wound therewith the boſom of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>The Governour finding the Lords divided amongſt themſelves, and their reaſons averſe to his intentions, and that not only the people, but the Souldiery were weary of him, and had bent their affections upon their young King, fooliſhly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the ignorance and ſimplicity of a child to his prudency, experience, and long practice of State, requeſted them to give him leave to return to <hi>France,</hi> and to forgive him any errour he had committed, which he proteſted was of ignorance not of malice. Having from men diſtaſted with him, without any oppoſition, obtained what he required, far from any outward ſhew of inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment, or diſquieting himſelf at the ingratitude of ſome whom he had advanced to Honors. he came to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where after ſome days ſtay with the King, when he had given him ſuch inſtructions of State, as he was able to underſtand (for he was but then in the thirteenth year of his Age) with many tokens of love, and demonſtrations of ſincere affection he took his leave of him: and his Ships attending his paſſage on the Weſt, with a great retinue of <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> he held his way towards them, and recommended him ſelf to the Sea in the Spring time, now the third time for <hi>France,</hi> after which he return'd not at all into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a Prince adorned with many Virtues, Active, Couragious, Reſolute, and knew how to uſe men as they are.</p>

               <p>His courteous nature went above his ambition; he could as well lay down his Honours, as he had modeſtly, when they were laid upon him, received them,</p>
               <p>Before the Rumor of the Duke of <hi>Albanies</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Seas was ſpread abroad, the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by ſecret Letters had required the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs,</hi> who then an Exile ſtaid in <hi>France,</hi> to come to him; after the receit of which, with a ſhort-leave taking he left <hi>France,</hi> where he had ſtaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt three years, cometh to <hi>England;</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> had brought him to believe. <hi>That the Duke had determined to extirpate his whole Linnage: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which he made him offer of Men and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to preſerve his own, and by his faction at home, and his aſſiſtance, to ſend the Duke over Seas; which if he had ſtaied, the Earl was eſteemed powerful enough to have accompliſhed</hi>

                  <hi>That, diſſention and hatred taken away between the two Nations, a faithful Peace might be agreed unto and confirmed, their Diſcords turned into Union, their Rancour into Love; which to bring to paſs and make durable, the only apparent and probable means, was to beſtow the Lady</hi> Mary <hi>the Kings daughter, upon</hi> James <hi>the young King of</hi> Scotland.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> with great joy applauded to what was ſaid: And King <hi>Henry</hi> appointed certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to treat about that purpoſe in private. Theſe when they had met to advance the Union of the Kingdoms, deſired theſe Conditions.</p>

               <p>When the day in which the Parliament ſhould have been held was come, the Queen and they who
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:175204:167"/>
were of her faction, as the Earls of <hi>Arran, Murray Eglintoun,</hi> fearing the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> might turn the wavering peoples affection, and move them to ſome Revolt, which might hinder their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or terrify the Commiſſioners by the frequent convention of his Friends and followers, conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their voices, and reſtraining their freedom of ſpeech: Or that they had a plot to ſurprize ſome of the contrary Faction, and by authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament commit them in that place, cauſed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made, <hi>That none of the three Eſtates ſhould ſit or aſſemble themſelves in the Town of</hi> Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, <hi>but that they ſhould keep their meeting in the Caſtle and there give their preſence.</hi> The Earls of <hi>Anguſs, Lennox, Arguyl,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Dumblane,</hi> with their adherents, and others, who joyned with them rather out of fear than good will, refuſe to enter the Caſtle, and require, <hi>That the Parliament be kept in the accuſtomed Place, the King may in Triumph be ſhewn to his own people, conveyed along the High-ſtreet.</hi> All which being denyed them, giving out <hi>That Juſtice was violated, the King kept againſt his will as a Priſoner, the Government and cuſtody of his perſon ſeiſed on without conſent of the three Eſtates,</hi> they ſurround the Caſtle with two thouſand men in Arms, ſtop all furniture of food and Victuals, which ſhould been afforded by the Town.

               </p>
               <p>In this Parliament the Authority of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is abrogated, by which means they ſaved him a labour from returning into <hi>Scotland</hi> again; <hi>Eight Lords were choſen to have the cuſtody of the Kings perſon quarterly, every one his Moneths ſucceſſively, and the whole to ſtand for the Government of the State; yet with this Limitation, That the King by their Counſel ſhould not determine, nor ordain any thing in great affairs to which the Queen, as Princeſs and Dowager, gave not her free conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Time urging reſolution, the Lords of Parliament direct the Earl of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> again to the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to declare their reſolution concerning the marriage of the King and the eſtabliſhing a Peace between the Kingdoms.</p>

               <p>Hereupon the Embaſſadours, their hopes of this Alliance delayed, having obtained a Truce between

the two Nations for the ſpace of three years and three moneths faithfully to be kept, returned to their own Country.</p>
               <p>The State began of new to be toſſed by the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Factions of the Queen and Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> the Original of which ſprang from matters of the Church; the Abbacy of <hi>Holy-rood-Houſe</hi> falling vacant by the promotion of <hi>George Creightoun</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Dunkell;</hi> the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs,</hi> to whom the cuſtody of the King was entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either by lot or conſent, moved him to confer this Abbacy upon his Brother Mr. <hi>William</hi> Prior of <hi>Coldin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> without acquainting the Queen with the Gift, or ſeeking the conſent of the other Rulers: at this the Queen turned ſo diſpleaſed, that abandoning the King to the pleaſure of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> She with her Followers retired to <hi>Sterlin.</hi> By this inconſiderate retreat the Earl adminiſtred all alone leaning to the greatneſs of his own power, that ſome might have thought the Queen ſet her Game to make up his. All favours and puniſhments paſs by him, All Offices and Places of importance are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his favourites; He made <hi>Archembald Dowglaſs</hi> his Uncle Treaſurer, Sir <hi>George</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Great Chamberlain; the Abbacies of <hi>Colding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Holy-rood-Houſe</hi> were in his Brothers hands, neither temporal nor eccleſiaſtical Dignity eſcapt him; his greatneſs inſtantly procureth him envy.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Saint Andrews,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Arran, Arguyl, Murray,</hi> who were of the Queens faction, lay a plot to accuſe <hi>Anguſs</hi> of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They challenge him, <hi>That he kept the King againſt his will, inſolently reſtrained his Liberty, and that contrary to the order eſtabliſhed by the Eſtates, which was that the cuſtody of his perſon ſhould every four Moneths by turns be allotted to the Governours
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:175204:169"/>
of the Country in a Circle, That he could not diſpoſe of any thing of moment alone, the contrary of all which he had uſurped; whereupon they charge him to diſmiſs the King, and reſtore him to them, and the other Counſellours equall in Government with him, under the pain he ſhould be reputed a Traytor and no loyal Subject, for this invaſſalling his Prince to his attendance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> himſelf to this anſwered not, but Sir <hi>George</hi> his Brother moved the King to give the anſwer himſelf. <hi>His Mother and thoſe other Rulers ſhould not be thus ſolicitous for him; for with none more cheerfully, willingly and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly could he live and ſpend his time than with the Earl of</hi> Anguſs, <hi>neither could he leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of one ſo highly favoured of his Uncle, and ſo well meriting of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all this anſwer he had ſecretly ſent Letters to his Mother, and thoſe of the adverſe party, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, <hi>They would remove him from the Earl, and not ſuffer him any longer to remain under his imperious Government, and if it could not be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done, to accompliſh it by main force of arms, if they had any pitty, or if any Sparks of duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unquenched in them towards him, if they dared Enterprize ought for a Royal, though now thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Upon this advertiſment the Queen and they of her Faction, aſſemble what power they could raiſe in ſuch a ſuddenneſs at <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition marched towards <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to ſeparate the King from the Earl his Guardian; Who, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to repel force by force, with the Townſmen of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:175204:169"/>
                  <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> many friends and adherents, and the King, though againſt his will, marched out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> to encounter the fight of theſe Rebels. When the Leaders of the Queens forces underſtood the King in perſon was in the adverſe Army, either dazled with the ſplendour of the preſence of a King or fearing if they joyned in battel, the perſon of their Prince might be endangered, or that they found themſelves not ſtrong enough in number and arms for a Conflict, they retired back again to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where they disbanded, and returned every man to his own dwelling place: The Queen with the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> went to <hi>Murray</hi>-land, the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> and <hi>Arguyl</hi> to the Weſt, the Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> to <hi>Dumfermling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Faction diſſipated, the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained more ſtable, and aſſured of his Guardianſhip, and now he findeth no Competitour.</p>
               <p>The want of the great Seal being a hinderance to many of his projects, and he diſdaining to be a ſuiter to his enemy; for diſpatch of publick affairs, cauſed the King ſend a Letter for it, and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop with all reſpect ſent it immediately to the Earl: with whom to be equal he took himſelf to new Meditations.</p>
               <p>The Queen many waies provokt by her Husband the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> and laſtly by detaining her Son againſt his will and contrary to the publick courſe agreed upon, the Archbiſhop perſuaded her <hi>To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a proceſs of Divorcement againſt him, and diſſolve her marriage; this might produce ſome great effect, at leaſt it could not but diminiſh the Earls reputation among the people.</hi> The Queen and the Earl many times in private between themſelves agreed upon a ſeparation, diſliking each others conditions; for it was fatal to her as to her Brother <hi>King Henry,</hi> to
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:175204:170"/>
delight in change of Wedlock, and be jealous of her Matches. The Earl is therefore cited before the Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> to hear the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced according to the Laws of the Church in thoſe times; at the day appointed he appeareth. The Queen alledged, <hi>He had been betroathed, given his faith and promiſe of marriage to a noble woman of the Kingdom (a daughter of</hi> Traquare) <hi>before the marrying of her, and ſo by reaſon of that Precontract he could not be her lawful husband.</hi> The Earl con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth; the Archbiſhop pronounceth the ſentence of Divorcement, but with this Reſervation and Reſtraint, <hi>That the Child come of the Queen and the Earl the time of their marriage, by the ignorance of the Mother (the Queen) ſhould not ſuffer any loſs, dammage or diſadvantage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> reſented highly this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcement, endeavour'd by his Letters to hinder it; for he thought ſome things tolerable in men, which were incompetent and ſhameful in women, and after never carried ſuch reſpect to his Siſter as he had done before. Of theſe ſhe made little reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for after the ſentence given, ſhe married <hi>Henry Stuart,</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Evendale,</hi> whom K. <hi>James,</hi> to do honour to his Mother, promoted to be Lord <hi>Meffan,</hi> and General of his Artillery.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the King remained a ſhadow to the Earls Government amidſt ſo many diſtractions, diſcords and jars of the Grandees, the Court turned ſolitary and unfrequented by any Noblemen, ſave theſe of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> own faction, amongſt which the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> ſhewed himſelf moſt indifferent. For he for his own ends attending the Court, in a ſhort time ſo framed himſelf to the Kings humours, that he delighted alone in his converſation, and often had none of his inward thoughts and ſecret intentions
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:175204:170"/>
from him. Among others he many times importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to give him a ſound advice how he might be delivered from the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> of whoſe bondage they had been long weary, whoſe rule over him was now turned into tyranny, his ambition hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mounted to that height that he was not content to command the Kingdom, but to thrall and keep under his Soveraign Lord the King himſelf, that the effects of his Governing were the diſperſing of his Nobles, and baniſhing of his mother from him.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> who by his familiarity with the King was become ſuſpicious of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> and had an intention to tumble out a man hated of his Prince, eſtabliſh himſelf in his place, and rule the young King alone, aggravating his and the Countries miſeries, told him, after much intreaty, The Lord of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clough</hi> was the only perſon to be imployed in ſuch a ſervice; a man of unlimited deſires, diſpleaſed, ſtrong in power, mightily hated, and who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred againſt the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> who wanted nothing but opportunity to execute his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: If this conceived exploit had not a deſired ſucceſs, then he himſelf would by main force either win his Prince, or loſe his life in the Enterpriſe. The Laird of <hi>Balclough</hi> ſecretly advertiſed of the Kings intention giveth way to much oppreſſion and many inſolencies on the borders, the redreſs of which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquired the preſence of the Prince. Complaints are given againſt them, and the King to do juſtice compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the Earls of <hi>Anguſs, Lennox,</hi> Lords <hi>Hume, Flamin, Areskin, Cesfoord Farnehaſt,</hi> and others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Jedbrough.</hi> But when they had ſtaied there ſome daies, ſmall redreſs was of wrongs, no juſtice executed, the chief men of the Borders not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Delinquents of their Names, to anſwer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law as was the ancient cuſtom. Thus as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:175204:171"/>

The Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> not a little mov'd at ſo ſudden an apparition, by an Herauld craveth to underſtand their intentions, and how in ſuch a hoſtile manner they dared come ſo near the Kings perſon, withal charging them under pain of high Treaſon to retire. The Laird of <hi>Balcloughs</hi> anſwer was, he came to do the King ſervice, invite him to his houſe, ſhow him what forces he was able to raiſe upon the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders when neceſſity ſhould require his ſervice and aſſiſtance. That he would not obey a charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings mind, of which he was conſcious, and herewith he marched forwards. Preſently the Earl alighting on foot, leaving the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> Lords <hi>Areskin, Maxwell,</hi> Sir <hi>George Dowglas, Ninian Creightoun</hi> with the King as Spectators of the Game, with the Lord <hi>Flammin</hi> and other his Friends, marſhall'd his Men for the Charge, which was given with a great ſhout and clamor of theſe Borderers. The Lord <hi>Hume,</hi> Lairds of <hi>Farnehaſt</hi> and <hi>Cesfoord</hi> had taken their leave of the King who gladly diſmiſt them, but upon advertiſement of the ſudden fray, being not far of they return in haſt with an hundred Launces, in good time for the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> and falling upon one of the Wings of <hi>Balcloughs</hi> troups force them to yield ground, and ſome to turn their backs, upon which ſuddenly followeth the Chaſe, <hi>Cesfoord</hi> and <hi>Farnehaſt;</hi> eagerly perſewing. Here at the deſcent of a little Hill, by the blow of a Launce which a Domeſtick of <hi>Balcloughs</hi> threw from his
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:175204:171"/>
Army, the Laird of <hi>Cesfoord</hi> is ſlain, and by his death the Chaſe left off to be follow'd, and a long deadly fewd between the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Cars</hi> was begun, fourſcore Borderers were kill'd in this bickering aſſiſting <hi>Balclough,</hi> himſelf was wounded with many of his friends, the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> loſt not a few beſides the Laird of <hi>Cesfoord.</hi>

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> after this road of <hi>Melroſs</hi> perceiving his enemies to increaſe, and the affections of ſome of the Nobility turned from him, compoſing the old difference between him and the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> entered into condition of a ſtrict friendſhip with him and was content he ſhould be his partner and fellow governour in diſtribution of Caſualities and ruling the Country. When the King had conſidered how twice his intentions had been broken, and unhappily without ſucceſs, he began to eſſay the third by the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> whom challenging of his promiſe he deſired to gather an Army, and joining his Forces with the Queens to reſtore him to his Liberty. The Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> before ſuſpected, after the League and friendſhip of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> with the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> became a declared enemy to <hi>Anguſs,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelf from Court: and ſome few Moneths being paſſed, at <hi>Sterlin</hi> he maketh a Declaration to all the Lieges, of his intentions, inviting them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> underſtanding theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to be againſt him, imploreth the aſſiſtance of his beſt Friends to withſtand them, eſpecially the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:175204:172"/>
                  <hi>Cars</hi> and <hi>Humes,</hi> to whoſe valour he had lately been ſo far obliged. He ſendeth Letters to the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> and the Gentlemen of the name of <hi>Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun,</hi> regretting the eſtate of the Commonwealth, requiring their ſpeedy aid. That in ſo perilous time ſetting aſide all particular Reſpects and Quarrels, they would have a care of the Common good of the Country. If the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> ſhould carry the King from him, and remained Victor of the Field, he would not ſtay there, his next mark would be the <hi>Hamiltouns</hi> whom he was in the way to put from all title to the Crown, the report going already that the King would intail it to him out of his own favour, and had deſigned him Heir to the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> he having no children of his own. That the King had a magnetical affection towards him, which, if Fortune favoured with a Victory, would increaſe; now meriting which before was but meer favour. The cuſtody of a young King was not for a man of ſo ſhort experience. The <hi>Hamiltouns</hi> finding that man their Suppliant who late was their Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor, delighting to live in a troubled State, and be Copartners of the Government and managing the affairs of the Kingdom, which was promiſed them in their new band of Friendſhip, laying aſide all former diſcontent and grudge accept the Quarrel, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their Forces at <hi>Linlithgow.</hi> To this Town the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> was advancing, and he being the Siſters Son of the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> by Gentlemen well affected towards him, and of his kindred, they intreat him to turn back, and not to try the hazard of a battel for a conqueſt; he could not long enjoy the Government of a young Prince, whom a little more time would make Governour of himſelf, and who (perhaps) would reward his ſervice with diſgrace; It being ordinarily ſeen that great obligations to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:175204:172"/>
Princes procure rather their hatred than love, whilſt it is more eaſie to pay men by contempt than benefits: that if he came forwards, no intereſt of blood would ſave him from their juſt and lawful ſtopping of his paſſage and enterprize. The Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, it was no time then in the eye of the World to abandon ſo juſt a quarrel, that ſhame wounded deeper than death, which he would rather imbrace than not ſee his Prince at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi> And finding the Bridge over the <hi>Avan</hi> poſſeſt by the Enemy, paſſed his Companies over the River <hi>Et</hi> near the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Monaſtery <hi>Immanuel;</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayers</hi> guideth the Vanguard, conſiſting of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land men; the Earl of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> and himſelf the main Battel, many of which were High-land men, being of all (as ſome write) ten thouſand. The Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> having eſſayed in vain to bring the King to the Field with the power of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> leaving that Charge to his Brother Sir <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Archembald Dowglaſs</hi> Provoſt of the Town, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the <hi>Humes</hi> and <hi>Cars,</hi> being of all two thouſand, maketh a ſpeedy march towards <hi>Lynlithgow.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> ſpurr'd by the ambition and youthful heat of his Son Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun,</hi> had begun the fight before he could appear; for a long time it is valiantly fought, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory inclining to neither ſide, till a great clamour aroſe, ſeconded by the appearance of freſh Troops of Enemies, the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> and their Friends, at which alarum many of the High-land and Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land men turned their backs; the reſt by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the place ſuſtain the Fight.</p>
               <p>The King; after much loytering and many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays (having heard the Armies were near joyning) and much ſolicitations of Sir <hi>George Dowglas,</hi> iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth out of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> at a ſlow march. But when
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:175204:173"/>
at <hi>Corſtorphine</hi> Hills he was awaken'd with the noiſe of the great Ordnance, he urged his Followers to make all haſte to come to the fight. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Sir <hi>George Dowglaſs</hi> drove his Horſe, in a great rage gave him injurious words, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after forgot. Being half way, he is advertiſed that the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> Highland-men were fled, and by all appearance the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> was Maſter of the Field. This news perplexed him not a little, but making the beſt of that worſt, he diſpatch'd all his domeſtick Servants with <hi>Andrew Wood</hi> of <hi>Largo,</hi> to ſave ſo many as they could in the Chaſe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Earl of <hi>Lennox,</hi> whoſe life he now ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth as his Crown. But this Earl after he had been taken by the Laird of <hi>Pardowye,</hi> in cold blood was unnaturally ſlain by Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun,</hi> who either killed or wounded on the face all that came under the dint of his Sword in the Rout.</p>
               <p>They found the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> mourning over his Corps, over which he ſpread his Cloak; the Laird of <hi>Howſtoun</hi> lay dead by him, the Maſter of <hi>Killmayers</hi> ſore wounded at their coming, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the fight, and was by them with difficulty ſaved, with ſo many others as either the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or their power could reſcue. This Conflict happened in <hi>September.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the victorious Earls had reſtored their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Soldiers, and refreſhed themſelves in <hi>Lithgow,</hi> they accompany the King to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately march through <hi>Fyffe</hi> in queſt of thoſe who had been the cauſe of taking Arms againſt them, of which number the Queen was; but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Saint Andrews</hi> was the moſt eminent, who, as before he had ſeconded <hi>Arran</hi> to ſurprize <hi>Anguſs,</hi> ſo now he had ſtirred <hi>Lennox</hi> to the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of them both. Becauſe the Archbiſhop was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:175204:173"/>
not to be found (for he (as ſome record) was turned a true Paſtour, and in Shepherds weeds kept Sheep on ſome Hill) they ſpoiled the Abbacy of <hi>Dumfermling,</hi> and Caſtle of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing all the Ornaments, and carryed away the Moveables and Stuff in them. The Queen with her Husband <hi>Henry Stuart,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> his Brother, betook them to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which the Lords at their return beſieged. The Mother hearing her Son was amongſt the Beſiegers in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, obtaing favour for her Husband and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cauſed the Gates to be caſt open. But for their ſafety ſuch who loved them, adviſed the King to commit them to that place during his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Now the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> and <hi>Arran</hi> ſummoned all who had born Arms againſt the King to appear in Judgment, and anſwer according to the Law as Traytors. Some compounded for Sums of Money, others became Dependers of the Houſes of <hi>Anguſs</hi> and <hi>Arran: Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> being ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned and compearing, <hi>Hugh Kennedy</hi> his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man anſwer'd the Indictment, that he came not againſt the King but to aſſiſt the King, for proof of which he offered to produce the Kings own Letter. Though the Earl of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> eſcaped the danger of the Law, he did not the fury of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, was taken about ſome diſparaging words; for as he was returning home, he was ſurprized in the way and killed; Some write by the Sheriff of <hi>Aire,</hi> but by the direction of Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and other Church-men in revenge of the ſpoiling of this Houſes, and perſuing himſelf, for queſtions of Religion, burn the Earl of <hi>Arrans</hi> Brothers Son Mr. <hi>Patrick Hamiltoun,</hi> and baniſh Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks</hi> Brother, <hi>James</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Lithgow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:175204:174"/>Not long after, mens wrath by time diminiſhing and their blood growing colder, the Archbiſhop having beſtowed on the Earl of <hi>Angus,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi> his Brother, and other their Friends, ſome Church Benefices and many Leaſes of Tythes, was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto them, and with appearance of great friendſhip they mutually entertained and feaſted each others at the <hi>Chriſt-Maſs</hi> in the City of St. <hi>Andrews.</hi> But ſmall confidence could be long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong reconciled Enemies.</p>
               <p>Now went every thing as the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> could have wiſhed, he was not only entire and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with the Kings Perſon, but with his Office; ſome of his Enemies were dead, others overthrown in open Field, with the reſt he was reconciled. No Faction for power or riches was equal to his; Nor remained there any Caſtle or Fortreſs not ſeiſed on by him, and garriſoned with his Friends and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, except the Caſtle of <hi>Sterlin,</hi> a part of the Queens Dowry, which being deſolate by her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, and only haunted by ſome of her pooreſt and meaneſt Servants, was neglected by the Earl, which in him was a great Error, the fitneſs of the place for a revolution and change of Court conſidered. Many days the Earl had not ſeen his own dwelling Places, nor thought upon his private Affairs, being carried away by the ſtorms of Court, now he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he may ſecurely paſs to <hi>Lothian,</hi> whilſt at <hi>Faulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the King ſhall be ſafely entertained by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sir <hi>George, Archembald</hi> his Uncle, and <hi>James</hi> of the <hi>Parkhead</hi> Captain of the Guards; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving earneſty entreated their attendance on the King, he croſſeth the <hi>Forth,</hi> with reſolution ſoon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. His departing was not ſo concealed, but the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> had knowledge of it, and he inviteth Sir <hi>George to ſee him in his City of
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:175204:174"/>
St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>to receive the Leaſes of the Tithes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, all now perfected, valid, and according to Law ſufficient.</hi> Whilſt Sir <hi>George</hi> is here detained, <hi>Archembald</hi> the Treaſurer by other Letters, for matters of love, is inticed to <hi>Dundee;</hi> But nothing could make the Captain of the Guards leave his Charge. The King amidſt his ſolitary Walks in his Park of <hi>Faulkland</hi> conſidering of what a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Train he was relieved, and how ſuddenly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion might turn her bald ſcalp, if preſently he took not hold of her, reſolveth to accompliſh by Stratagem, what the Factions of his Nobles could not perform by force. It is delightful to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand every particular circumſtance in the progreſs of the actions of Princes. Upon this reſolution he directeth <hi>the Forreſter of the Park to give adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement to ſuch Gentlemen about, who kept Hounds, the next morning to attend him, for he would early have his Game.</hi> He ſuppeth ſooner than his cuſtom was, entertaining the Captain of the Guards with more than uſual ceremonies and repreſentations of the next mornings ſport, withall <hi>inviting him to go to his reſt, the Night being ſhort about the Summer ſolſtice.</hi> The Waiters all ſhifted and the Court huſht, ſhutting his Chamber Door, in the Apparel of one of his Grooms, unperceiv'd he paſſed the Guard to the Stable; where with two who attended him, with ſpair Horſes he poſted to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> where by the Queens intelligence he was expected in the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>When the certainty of this eſcape was noiſed abroad, many Noblemen repair to <hi>Sterlin,</hi> ſome by Letters ſent unto them, others at the rumour of his evaſion, that in a little time he found him ſafe and far from any danger again to be ſurprized, the Earls of <hi>Arguyl, Atholl, Glancarn, Monteeth,

Huntley,</hi> The Lords <hi>Graham, Drummond, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſtoun, Sainclaire, Lindſay, Evandale, Ruthen, Maxwell, Simple,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Eglintoun, Rotheſs, James Beatoun</hi> Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Deviſer of his eſcape. The Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> full of miſs-giving thoughts, with many of his Friends, was alſo on his way to <hi>Sterlin;</hi> but Proclamation being made againſt him, <hi>Diſcharging him from all Offices and publick Functions, and being by an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld forbidden with his Friends and Followers to come near the Court by ſome Miles, under pain of Treaſon:</hi> either moved by inward terrours, or love of the Peace of his Countrey, turned back to <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lithgow,</hi> where two days he attended News of the Kings pleaſure, which at laſt was declared, <hi>That neither he nor none of his ſhould preſume by ſome miles to approach his Reſidence.</hi> The more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular favours were, <hi>That the Earl ſhould confine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond the River of</hi> Spay <hi>in the North, whilſt his Brother, Sir</hi> George Dowglaſs, <hi>ſhould render himſelf Priſoner in the Caſtle of</hi> Edenburgh, <hi>and there remain during the Kings pleaſure.</hi> When the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> had refuſed theſe offers, they are cited to anſwer according to Law in a Parliament to be holden in <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>before the day of appearing, the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> accompanied with an able Train of his Friends and Followers eſſayeth to enter the Town of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and there attend the coming of the King; but by the Lord of <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Lochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> who in the Kings Name had inveſted the Town, he is kept out, and the King with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſuddenneſs, with two thouſand men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from <hi>Sterlin,</hi> he removed.

Sir <hi>George Dowglaſs, Archembald Dowglaſs</hi> his Uncle, <hi>Alexander Drummond</hi> of <hi>Carnock,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The points of which they were to be accuſed, were, <hi>The aſſembling of the Kings Lieges with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to have aſſailed his Perſon; The detaining of the King againſt his will and pleaſure, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Articles agreed upon the ſpace of two years and more; all which time the King was in fear and danger of his life.</hi> At this Parliament (ſome write) the King made a ſolemn Oath never to give a Remiſſion to any of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> there forfeited, as the Lords did, never to interceed nor requeſt for any of them: and in diſgrace of the Earl of <hi>Angus, Henry Stuart</hi> who had married the Queen his Wife, was created Lord <hi>Meffan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> having all favour denied them, being openly declared Enemies to the King and Countrey, commit all Hoſtility (the laſt refuge of deſperate men) on their Enemies bounds, <hi>Cauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Cranſtoun</hi> are burned, they ravage even to the Gates of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> the harmleſs people ſuffering for the faults of the great; under ſhadow of their Followers all Robberies and Oppreſſions brake forth, and by whomſoever committed, are laid to their charge. The King will not hear of them in any other terms than Oppreſſours and common Robbers. In their defence they fortifie their Caſtle of <hi>Tantallon</hi> with the readieſt Proviſion taken from the neareſt adjacent bounds. In <hi>October</hi> the King raiſeth a great company of Soldiers, with great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnance, and other Engines of War brought from the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbar, Tantallon</hi> is beſieged, but proveth impregnable; and <hi>David Faulconer</hi> the General of the Ordnance at their removing is ſlain. A Commiſſion is ſent to the Earl of <hi>Bothwell,</hi> as
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:175204:176"/>
the Kings Lieutenant, to invade with Fire and Sword in all places the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> which he, either out of human compaſſion, or that he knew wiſe States-men ſhould extenuate the faults of others rather than aggravate them, refuſed to accept. But the Earl of <hi>Arguyl</hi> and Lord <hi>Hume</hi> accepted that charge, proſecute them where they might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, till after much miſery and night-wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at home, they were conſtrained with <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Drummond</hi> of <hi>Carnock,</hi> who had been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of their misfortunes by his conſanguinity with the Earls Mother, who was Daughter to the Lord <hi>Drummond,</hi> to fly into <hi>England,</hi> where they were charitably received, and honourably entertained by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight.</p>
               <p>Now are the Offices and Lands of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> diſpoſed upon; the Archbiſhop of <hi>Glaſgow, Gavin Dumbar</hi> is made Chancellor, <hi>Robert Bartoun,</hi> who was in eſpecial favour with the King, Treaſurer, great Cuſtomer General of the Artillery and Mines, and other Charges are given unto others.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> intended a War againſt the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, ſendeth Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>Scotland</hi> for a certain time to treat a Peace, and if it were poſſible to reconcile the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> with the King. Five years truce was reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but for the <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> the King would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to no offers; only <hi>Alexander Drummond</hi> by the interceſſion of <hi>Robert Bartoun,</hi> and the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, had liberty to return home. When the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Murray,</hi> who had full power to conclude a Truce, had met the other Commiſſioners upon the Borders, the Factious great men and rank Ryders there, put all in ſuch a confuſion by urging difficulties, that they parted without agreeing unto any Articles or certain
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:175204:176"/>
Concluſions: which the King took in ſo evil a part, that divining from what head this interruption ſprung, he committed ſundry Noblemen to the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> till they gave Hoſtages, and ſecured the Borders from invaſion or being invaded. In the month of <hi>June</hi> following with a great power he viſited theſe bounds, executing Juſtice upon all Oppreſſours, Thieves and Out-Laws. In <hi>Ewſdale</hi> eight and fourty notorious Riders are hung on grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trees, the moſt famous of which was <hi>John Arm-ſtrong;</hi> others he brought with him to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> for more publick Execution and Example, as <hi>William Cockburn</hi> of <hi>Henderland, Adam Scot</hi> of <hi>Tuſhelaw,</hi> named King of Thieves.</p>
               <p>The year 1530. the King inſtituted the Colledge of Juſtice; before it was ambulatory, removing from place to place by Circuits; Suits of Law were peremptorily decided by Bayliffs, Sheriffs, and other Judges; when any great and notable cauſe offered it ſelf, it was adjudged Soveraignly by the Kings Council, which gave free audience to all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The power and priviledges of this Colledge was immediately confirmed by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Seventh.</p>
               <p>In this Court are fifteen Judges ordinary, eight of them being Spiritual Perſons, of the which the moſt antient is Preſident, and ſeven Temporal men: The Chancellor of the Realm when he is preſent is above the Preſident, There are alſo four Councellors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, removeable at the Princes pleaſure.</p>
               <p>This Inſtitution is after that <hi>Order</hi> of Juſtice which is adminiſtred in <hi>Paris,</hi> firſt inſtituted by <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, the <hi>French</hi> King the year 1286.</p>
               <p>The King about this time ſtoreth his <hi>Arſenals</hi> with all ſort of Arms; the Caſtles of <hi>Edenburgh, Sterlin, Dumbartoun</hi> and <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> are repaired

               <p>Whilſt no certain Truce is concluded between the Realms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Angus</hi> worketh in this interim ſo with the King of <hi>England,</hi> that Sir <hi>Edward Darcey</hi> is ſent to the Borders; who when his ſolicitation for reſtoring the Earl, at the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Court had taken no effect, yea had been ſcorned, after he had ſtaied at <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> with the Garriſoned Soldiers, and ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected companies out of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland</hi> maketh a Road into <hi>Scotland; Coldingham, Dunglas,</hi> and adjacent Villages they burn, ravage the Countrey towards <hi>Dunce.</hi> Some <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ships and Veſſels were alſo at this time taken by Sea. When a reaſon was ſought of this Invaſion in a Ceſſation of Arms, and calm of Truce; <hi>They require the</hi> Dowglaſſes <hi>may be reſtored to their ancient Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and whatſoever had been with-held from them, and that</hi> Cannabie <hi>(a poor Abbacy) be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>as appertaining of old to the Crown of</hi> England. The Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> being declared Lieutenant maketh head againſt them: but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> daily increaſing in number, and his Companies not being ſufficient to make good againſt ſo many and large Incurſions, the power of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is divided into four Quarters, every one of which for the durance of fourty days by turns taketh the defence of the Countrey. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> finding by this intercourſe of new Soldiers the War to be prolonged, would have gladly accepted of Peace, but they diſdained to ſue for it to the <hi>Scots:</hi> it was thought expedient that the <hi>French,</hi> a Friend then to both, ſhould be a Mediatour to reconcile them, wherupon, after an Ambaſſador had come from <hi>France,</hi> Commiſſioners firſt meet at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and after at <hi>London, James Colvil</hi> of Eaſter <hi>Weyms, Adam

               </p>
               <p>About this time the ſecrets of the Eccleſiaſtical Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Authority beginning to be laid open to the view of the World, the politick Government of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes began to ſuffer in the alteration and diſcovery. The Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabella,</hi> King and Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Siſter to the Mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth Emperor, had been Married to <hi>Arthur</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Eldeſt Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh King of <hi>England,</hi> he dying, by the diſpenſation of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the Second, her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law gave her again in Marriage to <hi>Henry</hi> his other Son, the Brother of <hi>Arthur.</hi> This Queen though fruitful of Children, and often a Mother, brought none forth that long enjoyed life, and came to any perfection of growth, except one only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Mary.</hi> Her Husband either out of ſpleen againſt the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> or deſire of Male Children, or other Cauſes known to himſelf, <hi>pretended great ſcruples in his Conſcience, would make himſelf and the World believe, that his Marriage was not lawful.</hi> After deliberation with his Church-men, whom he conſtrained to be of his mind, he kept not longer company with his Queen; his Church-men uſed all their eloquence to make the Queen accept of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, which ſhe altogether refuſed, and had her recourſe to the Pope, who recals the cauſe to himſelf. At <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt in the conſiſtory the caſe is made dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and the matter prolonged, King <hi>Henry</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of delays, and amorous, divorceth from his own Queen and Marrieth <hi>Anne Bullen</hi> 1533.</p>
               <p>Then the Pope with his whole Cardinals gave out
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:175204:178"/>
their Sentence, That it was not lawful for him by his own authority, to ſeparate himſelf from his Wife; that his Marriage with <hi>Katharine</hi> was moſt lawful, not to be queſtioned, and that under pain of Excommunication he ſhould adhere unto her.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> well experienced in the great Affairs of the World, conſidering how the threatnings and thunders of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> even in theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and innocent times when they were believed and reverenced, in his Kingdom produced never great Effects, thought them to no purpoſe in a time when a Doctrine was publiſht to the World, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and believed of numbers, by which they were contemned and ſcorned: upon this and other grounds he refuſeth to obey, and the Pope conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth his menacing.</p>
               <p>This diſorder and boldneſs of the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> moved the Emperor and the Pope to try if they could win the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ariſe in Arms againſt his Uncle King <hi>Henry.</hi> The Emperour eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayeth it under pretence of other buſineſs of great importance. For having given way to new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Religion amongſt his Countrey-men in <hi>Germany,</hi> and finding them mounted to that height as to have produced the Effects he deſired, (by this Diviſion laying a foundation to turn the Imperial Crown Hereditary to his own Houſe, which, <hi>Germany</hi> being all of one mind and undiſtracted, he could never have brought to paſs) he compelleth the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> to condeſcend to a general Council or Aſſembly of the Clergy of <hi>Europe,</hi> the onely and ſoveraign Remedy to cure diſeaſed minds, and accord different Opinions: but he knew well that by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> men would be delegated to this meeting, turbulent, and ſo far from pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tumults begun, that inſtead of Water they would
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:175204:178"/>
apply Oyl and Wood to theſe flames, turn Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before diſputable, irreconcileable, and leave matters worſe than they found them. Having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the aid and aſſiſtance of the Potentates about him to the ſetting forward of ſo Pious and Holy a Work, he ſendeth <hi>Goddeſcallo Errico</hi> (a <hi>Sicilian</hi>) for greater ſecrecy by <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Embaſſador for a token of that affection the Emperour his Maſter carried to the Perſon and Virtues of King <hi>James,</hi> preſenteth him with the Order of the Golden-fleece 1534. with ſolemn Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations for the obſerving of theſe ancient Leagues and Confederacies contracted between the Princes his Maſters Predeceſſors and the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to continue ever amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>His other Inſtructions were <hi>Plains of the wrongs done to his Aunt</hi> Katharine, <hi>moſt unjuſtly repudiate and forſaken by a King forſaken of God and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of men. The Marriage of</hi> Anne Bullen <hi>ſhould wound deeply King</hi> James, <hi>it being likely by her Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion he ſhould be barred of his Right to the Crown of</hi> England: <hi>The Emperour by his Embaſſador ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating the wrongs of his Aunt, had gained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that for his ſake She was the worſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained. To make more ſtrong and laſting the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours friendſhip with King</hi> James, <hi>he (if he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) would make him an offer, and give him the choice of three Ladies, three</hi> Maries, <hi>all of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Stem:</hi> Mary <hi>of</hi> Auſtria <hi>the Emperours Siſter, the Widow of</hi> Lovis <hi>King of</hi> Hungary; Mary <hi>of</hi> Portugal, <hi>the Daughter of his Siſter</hi> Eleonara <hi>of</hi> Auſtria: Mary <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>the Daughter of</hi> Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine <hi>and King</hi> Henry. <hi>And would undertake the performance of this laſt, either by conſent of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by main force. The greateſt but laſt of his
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:175204:179"/>
Inſtructions was that to ſuppreſs the Hereſies of the time he would concur with the Emperour for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating a general Council, and obviate the Calamities then threatning the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King with great cheerfulneſs and many thanks, that the Emperour entertained him with ſuch reſpect, and held him worthy ſo fair and Royal Alliance, and the participation of Affairs of ſuch importance and moment, received this Embaſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Council, providing it were a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil lawfully convocated by the Emperour and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings, as the firſt Councils were wont, free and holy (as nothing is more holy than a general Convocation of Chriſtians) the moſt charitable and quiet of the Clergy, and ſuch who would pacifie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not the moſt zealous and fiery Spirits, or men corrupted by rewards being delegated unto it, being premoniſht of the time and place, he would apply his will unto his, aſſiſt him, thither ſend his beſt Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and moſt convenient Church-men. That if a true Council could not be obtained, every Prince ſhould reform the Errors of Doctrine and faults of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy within his own Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The proceedings of his Uncle were grievous unto him, being a man altogether thralled to his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. For the good of the Chriſtian Religion and Peace of</hi> Europe, <hi>it were expedient that all her Princes were united together in amity and love, and their Arms directed againſt the common Enemy the</hi> Turk. <hi>For himſelf he would be Mediatour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the Emperour and his Uncle, endeavour to recall him to the love of his Wife, nor by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions to be induced to condeſcend to ought preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to Queen</hi> Katherine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The three Ladies were every one in the ſuperlative worthy, eſpecially</hi> Mary <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>for that great
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:175204:179"/>
reaſon of uniting the Iſle of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>but ſhe was not in her own power, nor in the power of the Emperour, that he could beſtow her upon whom he pleaſed. That to raviſh her out of the hands of her Father would be, beſide the danger of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, a breach of Divine and Human Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was not ſafe for</hi> Paris <hi>that he preferred one of the three Goddeſſes to the other two, for prizing thoſe three (that the Emperour might know how dearly he reſpected and earneſtly affected his affinity) there remained a fourth Lady near in blood to the Emperour,</hi> Iſabella <hi>Daughter of</hi> Chriſtian <hi>King of</hi> Denmark, <hi>and</hi> Iſabella <hi>the Emperours own Siſter, whom, beſides her matchleſs virtues, for the vicinity of the Nation to his, and the conformity of their harmleſs humors, he made choice to be Queen of his affections and Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goddeſcallo</hi> anſwered this laſt, <hi>That a match with Lady</hi> Iſabella <hi>of</hi> Denmark <hi>could not with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours credit be brought to paſs, becauſe ſhe was promiſed already to another,</hi> Frederick <hi>Count Palatine, and the Marriage might be accompliſhed before news came to the Emperour of the Kings Election.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This choice of the Kings was but on evaſion, for Sir <hi>Thomas Areskin</hi> of <hi>Brichen</hi> Secretary, and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Beatoun</hi> Abbot of <hi>Arbroth,</hi> under pretence of renewing the League between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> long before had been directed to <hi>France</hi> about a Marriage with the eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Francis,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> projected when the League between the two Kingdoms was renewed at <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had now renounced all obedience from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and through his whole Dominions abrogated his Authority, and <hi>Paul</hi> the third after his aſſuming the Papacy, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:175204:180"/>
by the Emperour and his Cardinals, who thought either to recover <hi>England</hi> or burn it up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Foreign or Civil War, never left thundring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But after <hi>John Fiſher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> was beheaded (a man impriſoned for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the Pope, then for his perſecution, and that the King might carry him the greater reſpect, made Cardinal) the whole Conclave ſtir the Pope againſt King <hi>Henry.</hi> And full of Grief and rage remonſtrate what danger would follow their Order if this Example unpuniſht ſhould have way. They maintained the Papal power againſt all Princes, which now for fear of their Lives they would be forced to forſake, or to proceed with great timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs and neglect, if by any ſecular power they might be called in Judgment and embrue Scaffolds with their blood. The Pope, though highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokt, parted not from his Reſolution, yet uſed a ſort of moderation; he threatneth ſtill to let fall the blow, in the mean time holding his hand.</p>
               <p>Thus to give ſatisfaction to his Court, he formed a Proceſs againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> and a moſt ſevere Sentence, but abſtained from the publication of it during his pleaſure; Secretly ſending many Copies of it to thoſe Princes he thought could be uſeful to his Deſigns when occaſion ſhould ſerve, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with a conſtant rumor of the Bull ſhortly to be put in execution and publiſht.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many intereſted in wrongs by the King of <hi>England,</hi> conſidering there was none comparable to the Nation and King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> he directeth hither <hi>John Antonio Compeggio;</hi> This Legate find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth King <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Faulkland</hi> 22. <hi>February</hi> 1535. and here with many Ceremonies and Apoſtolical Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, delivereth him a <hi>Cap and a Sword, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the Night of the Nativity of our Saviour:
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:175204:180"/>
which the fame of his valour and many Chriſtian virtues had moved his Maſter to remunerate him with. Alſo</hi> (ſaith the Original) <hi>that it might breed a terror in the heart of a wicked neighbouring Prince againſt whom the Sword was ſharpned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Popes Letter in moſt ſubmiſſive ſtile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, <hi>A Complaint for the death of</hi> John <hi>Biſhop and Cardinal of</hi> Rocheſter, <hi>miſerably taken away by the hand of an Hang-man. The Calamities of</hi> England <hi>occaſioned by the Kings Divorce from</hi> Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>and his Marriage with</hi> Ann Bullen; <hi>That ſince the</hi> Roman <hi>Church had received great diſgrace and a deadly wound, and by patience procured more and more wrongs from, the King of</hi> England, <hi>She was conſtrained to uſe a ſearing Iron. For the application of which She had recourſe to his Majeſty, a Prince for his Anceſtors piety and his own renowned. His aid, maintenance, protection ſhe implored; Since King</hi> Henry <hi>was a Deſpiſer, a Scorner, One who ſet at naught the cenſures of the Church: an Heretick, Schiſmatick, a ſhameful and ſhameleſs Adulterer, a publick and profeſt homicide Murtherer, a Sacrilegious Perſon, a Church-Robber, a Rebel guilty of leſe-Majeſty Divine, outragious, many and innumerable ways a Felon, a Criminal: By all Laws herefore juſtly to be turned out of his Throne: The King of</hi> Scotland <hi>for the Defence of the Church would undertake ſomething worthy a Chriſtian King and himſelf: he would endeavour to ſuppreſs Hereſie, defend the Catholick faith againſt thoſe whom the juſtice of Almighty God, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were now prepared and already ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King kindly entertained the Legate, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Pope with much regret for the eſtate and ſtubborneſs of the King of <hi>England.</hi> Who would
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:175204:181"/>
not be ſtruck with Pitty that a King who late amongſt Chriſtian Princes was honoured with the Title of <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> ſhould be obnoxious to ſo many Crimes, that now amongſt Princes he could ſcarce be reputed a Chriſtian? This Compaſſion was common to him with others, but he by a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nature, and nearneſs of Blood felt a more piercing ſorrow; he ſhould leave no means untried to recal his Uncle to the obedience of the Church: and though by his Embaſſadors, he had once or twice went about the ſame, but in vain, he would ſtudy a way how face to face he might give him his beſt Counſel, and remonſtrate how much good he would do the Chriſtian World and himſelf by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to the Church. Mean while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him not to be heady, forward nor raſh in executing the Sentence againſt his Uncle, which would but obdure him in his ſeparation.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> not having loſt all hopes of his Uncle, directeth the Lord <hi>Areskin</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> to acquaint him with the Emperors and Popes Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; and to take his Counſel about a Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Vandoſons</hi> Daughter whom the <hi>French</hi> King had offered to him, his own Daughter being weak and ſickly. In this Embaſſage there was a complaint againſt the <hi>Londoners, who in their paſſage to the Iſland fiſhing, ſpoiled the Coaſts of</hi> Orknay <hi>and the adjacent Iſlands: with a Roqueſt that King</hi> Henry <hi>would not ſuccour the</hi> Lubeckers <hi>againſt the Duke of</hi> Hulſtein.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> not to prove inferior to the Emperour and Pope in conferring honours upon his Nephew, admitteth him to the Fraternity of the <hi>Garter,</hi> which he delivered to the Lord <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin</hi> his Embaſſador. And thereafter diſpatched <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:175204:181"/>
(as if that name were a ſufficient Scar-crow to the Popes Sword and the Emperours <hi>Golden-fleece</hi>) to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who made ſuch haſty Journeys that he prevented the News of his coming, and at unawares found the King at <hi>Sterlin.</hi> The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Embaſſage was, That the King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> might have an interview at <hi>York,</hi> at which meeting the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould be declared Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and General Lieutenant of the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> That his Maſter having Inſtructions of the Alliance offered him by neighbouring Princes, did offer to his own and his Counſels, judgments if they could find a more fit, than to contract a Marriage with his Daughter, which might be eaſily perfected if his Maſter and King <hi>James</hi> could condeſcend upon ſome few points.</p>
               <p>When the King had taken theſe Propoſitions into deliberation, the Church-men ſuſpecting if this meeting and match had way, the King would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Opinions of the new Reformers, ſet all their wits to overthrow it. The neareſt Succeſſors to the Crown, covering their claim and intereſt, argued, <hi>That to Marry the Lady</hi> Mary <hi>of</hi> England <hi>who for many years would not he marriagable was not a right way to continue his Race by procreation of Children, and that his impatience of living alone, would not be much abated by marrying a Child. That King</hi> Henry <hi>projected this Marriage to no other end than to hinder him from better Alliances, or to facilitate an entry to the Kingdom. That when a Prince would take advantage of any neighbour Prince, it was more ſafely done by Alliance than open force. That it was more ſafely, King</hi> Henry <hi>being a wary Prince, never meant to marry his Daughter at all as long as himſelf lived, but to keep her at Home with him, bearing many Princes in
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:175204:182"/>
hand to ſave him from Dangers both at home and abroad: which counſel was practiſed lately by the Duke of</hi> Burgundy.</p>
               <p>Moſt oppoſe neither to the meeting of the two Kings, nor to the Alliance, but to the place of their meeting, which ſeemed unto them of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, being in the heart of <hi>England,</hi> and amidſt the moſt martial people of that Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They require the two Kings might have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview at</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>this place, when they meet, being moſt commodious for furniſhing all neceſſaries by Ships; That the number of their Train ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, as one thouſand, which none of the two Kings ſhould exeeed. That the time ſhould be at the Feaſt of Saint</hi> Michael <hi>the Arch-Angel between the Harveſt and the Winter, which would haſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of the Ceremonies, and not ſuffer the Kings to prolong time, but invite their return to their own chief and principal Cities.</hi> When it was declared to the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> that the conſent of the Nobles of the Kingdom obtained, the enterview at the Feaſt of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> might be condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; he would neither accept of the place nor time, <hi>His Maſter having already (as matter he had never put in queſtion) made great preparations for this interview at</hi> York, <hi>that he would think his offers ſlighted and an affront put upon him, if any excuſes were alledged to the contrary:</hi> Thus with ſome bravadoes to the Council he departed.</p>
               <p>The King to give ſatisfaction to his Uncle of his Councils proceedings with the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after him Sir <hi>Adam Otterburn</hi> of <hi>Red-hall,</hi> who layeth the fault of his not appearing upon the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> complaining, <hi>That he menaced the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, and would have forced their Votes; that he was a Friend to Sir</hi> George Dowglaſs <hi>and other
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:175204:182"/>
Rebels, who convoyed him to</hi> Scotland, <hi>and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him back again. It was againſt the credit and honour of free born Princes to be threatned, what was friendly begun ſhould friendly continue and end: Princes ſhould not be conſtrained, eſpecially in matters which were not of Debt but benevolence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe importunities and ſolicitations King <hi>James</hi> with five well manned Ships taketh the Seas, giving out a Voyage for <hi>France;</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> record it was his firſt adventure to come to them: but it is more likely this proceeded from Policy of State, to try the affections and demeanour of the great ones of his Kingdom in his abſence, rather than any intended Voyage towards Forreigners.

                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:175204:190"/>The King followed not this opinion, but gave himſelf over to the Counſel and Government of the Prelates. They remonſtrate to him, that he ſhould not raſhly alter approv'd and long receiv'd Cuſtoms; that there was nothing more dangerous in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to abaſe the authority of ancient Laws. Let him well conſider and ſet before his eyes the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of man, who ever when he is drawn off one courſe of evil, precipitateth himſelf in a worſe; It was leſs evil in State to tolerate diſorders known, unto which uſual and accuſtomed remedies might be applyed, than by altering and changing foundations to give way to new, to find out Remedies to which, would take and conſume a whole age. That this would be a way, not only to take away the abuſes, but even the good uſes of every thing, and put in hazard all matters and main points concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They deſired him to conſider how there were two ſorts of perſons affecting theſe new Opinions and ſtudying Novations. The multitude or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, and ſome of the Nobility and Gentry. It was likely the common people might be deceived; and to give them ſatisfaction, and appeaſe them, by granting them a Reformation or change in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, would not be a means to illuminate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, but to bring in a popular licence. If he ſhould ſuffer them to misbelieve, diſtruſt, call in queſtion points of Religion, or ſearch or find out more light, they would immediately thereafter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to make Laws and limit the Government, by degrees reſtraining the Soveraign Authority, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had examined, ſifted narrowly, and diſcuſt Eccleſiaſtical authority, they would eſſay to correct and find the difficulties of the Temporal. That it was more eaſie to oppoſe and reſiſt the firſt demands of the multitude, than pleaſing them in a part, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:175204:191"/>
bound and limit their deſires and petitions. As to the great Men of his Nobility and Gentry he might be aſſured they had not Religion and Piety for their Ends, but to impatronize and lay hold on the Church Rents, and Eccleſiaſtical Goods. To turn abſolute and free men, acknowledging neither Church nor King. To this end many reſerved themſelves, and kept cloſe their opinions, attending the change: which once appearing, their faces would turn all one way. Which imminent evils, if the King would prevent, there was no other means than to uſe his Authority and Power, whilſt the moſt and greateſt part of his Kingdom yet obey'd him. That cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this was moſt neceſſary, before their number increas'd, and ere they diſcover'd that univerſal commodity, which would follow the imbracing of theſe new Opinions. It was ſafer to compoſe theſe Tumults by his abſolute command and authority, and if this produced not the wiſhed effect, to perform it by Arms, than to give reins to a popular Licence, and the ambition of great Men.</p>
               <p>After this Counſel had prevailed, moſt rigorous Inquiſitions are Eſtabliſhed, and puniſhments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt all who profeſſed Opinions differing to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>It was time for him to look to himſelf. Such of the Nobility as loved peace, and the Weal of the the two Kingdoms, ſtirr'd King <hi>James</hi> to this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view,

eſpecially they who favour'd the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; aſſuring him King <hi>Henry</hi> was diſpoſed with all demonſtrations of good will, that his Perſon would be far from any danger. And if by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they ſhould join in bands of Amity, a great benefit to themſelves, Country and Poſterity would redound. Why would King <hi>Henry</hi> in the face of the World and Neighbour Princes, brand ſo his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as to break the Laws of Hoſpitality, wrong a Prince whom he had invited to come and ſee him? Why would he violate thoſe of conſanguinity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting againſt his own Nephew? The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had been his Gueſt, and after Royal entertainment, was friendly diſmiſſed. He met with <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King at <hi>Bullen;</hi> which meeting ſeemed rather of Brothers come to countenance ſome marriage Pomp, than contending Neighbours. If King <hi>Henry</hi> had born any diſcontent againſt his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, he might long ere now have ſatisfied his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and at more eaſie rate, when the King his Father with moſt of the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> receiv'd that fatal overthrow by the Hills of <hi>Flowden</hi> and <hi>Banks</hi> of <hi>Till;</hi> the refuſing of an interview might divide the King and his Uncle upon which might follow ſome unnatural War.</p>
               <p>Upon the other part the Church-men ſet all their Power to hinder this interview, perſuading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves it would give a terrible blow to their Eſtates or Religion. The principal cauſe (ſay they) why the King of <hi>England</hi> is ſo paſſionately earneſt to have this meeting, is to perſuade his Nephew to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Church-matters in <hi>Scotland</hi> to thoſe already begun in <hi>England;</hi> to aboliſh the Popes Authority, to drive Religious Perſons from their Lands, Rents, Houſes; inveſt the Jewels and Ornaments of the Churches. Which counſel and example if King

                  <hi>James</hi> ſhould follow, he would hazard or loſe the friendſhip he had with the Pope, Emperour and <hi>French</hi> King, his beſt Confederates, abandoned of which he and his Kingdom would be left a Prey to the tyranny of his Uncle; if <hi>Henry</hi> kept no faith to God, Men had no reaſon to truſt unto him. That this Interview was to intrap his Perſon; He being the man whom the Pope and Emperour had deſigned to ſet upon his Throne, and revenge their quarrels; That it was groſly to err, to be carried away with a ſhadow and appearance and leave a Subſtance, to truſt at once his Crown, Perſon and Liberty to an Enemy. And ſith examples move more than Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, let him think upon the hazard of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, eighteen years Priſoner, and after ſold to his Subjects: <hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Kings of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> He ſhould remember (if yet he were therein to be inſtructed) that Princes ſerve themſelves with occaſions over their Neighbours, that they have greater care to ſatisfie their ambition, than fear of ſhame for doing of wrongs with the preſent times or poſterity. That their Oaths were no longer kept than they obſerved their advantages. That after he falleth in his hands, he ought to follow his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Religion, forſaking and giving over his own natural diſpoſition, manners and freedom, have no other affections nor motions than his. For who cometh under the roof of a Tyrant turneth ſlave, though he was a free man ere he did enter. That this meeting with the Body, would endanger the Soul and infect it with his Errors, corrupting it with falſe opinions grounded upon a liberty to live to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and <hi>Epicurean</hi> pleaſure. If upon the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Interview, King <hi>Henry</hi> ſhould denounce War againſt King <hi>James</hi> and invade his Countrey, they in his juſt defence ſhould furniſh Moneys to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:175204:193"/>
an Army and overturn his proceedings. For the preſent neceſſity they offer to pay to him fifty thouſand Crowns yearly; and in any hazard of the Eſtate voluntarily to contribute all their Rents and Revenues, providing it would pleaſe his Majeſty to ſuffer juſtice to proceed againſt thoſe who ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly had ſequeſtred themſelves from the holy Church, and to the contempt of his Laws publickly made profeſſion of the opinions of <hi>Luther.</hi> That the Goods of all who ſhould be convict of Hereſie (which they eſteemed to no leſs than an hundred thouſand Crowns of yearly Rent) ſhould be brought to the Exchequer, and their Lands annext to the Crown. To this effect they intreat his Majeſty to give them ſufficient Judges truly Catholick and full of zeal and ſeverity.</p>
               <p>After long reaſoning upon both ſides it was agreed, the King ſhould not altogether refuſe to meet his Uncle, but adhere to the firſt offer propounded to his Embaſſadour concerning this Interview. The meeting to be at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> one thouſand at the moſt in train with either King, the time to be the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conditions not being embraced by King <hi>Henry,</hi> would if not aboliſh totally, at the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the time of this meeting; the King of <hi>England</hi> thinketh his Nephew too imperious to aſſume the Injunction of the whole circumſtances of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but rather than his ſuit ſhould take no effect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth both of the Place and number of the Train: and that he might have ſome point yielded unto him, requireth the time may be the firſt of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Theſe Conditions being almoſt agreed upon, three or four hundreth <hi>Riddeſdale</hi> and <hi>Tinedale</hi> men, with other Borderers, break upon <hi>Liddeſdale,</hi> and there with large incurſions kill and forrage. This during the

Treaty falling miſerably forth, ſo much irritated King <hi>James,</hi> that, accepting the offers of his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, he gave over inwardly all intentions of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview: By prolonging time labouring to winde himſelf out of the Maze. Hereupon he ſendeth Letters full of excuſes for his ſtay; repreſenting his many grievances and wrongs ſuffer'd; and the ſeeds of diſcord began now to be ſown amongſt them.

For whilſt he perſecuteth all who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed againſt to be ſuſpected of the Reform'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, having many in Jayls, and numbers in his Scrolls to bring within the Labyrinth of a Proceſs, the ſupream Providence arreſteth himſelf.</p>

private Affairs in order, cometh home. Where finding the cenſorian Power to be in his Couſens hands (for where ſhould he have Sanctuary, if he were challenged by ſo near a Kinſman for matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?) imagining to himſelf an over-ſight and preterition, out-dateth by his ſtay his Protection. Sir <hi>James</hi> to curry the favour of the Church-men, and teſtifie how dearly the cauſe of the Catholick Faith touched him, reſolveth to begin with his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. For if he were ſo burnt up with zeal, that he ſpar'd not his own blood in the quarrel of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Faith, what Heretick could paſs unpuniſht? Beſides the inveſting himſelf in the Sheriffs Office and Lands (which he never minded to reſtore) he had a Pick againſt him, for that whilſt he ſat Judge in <hi>Lithgow,</hi> he pronounced a Sentence by which he was intereſted in ſome petty gain.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff falling ſo far ſhort of his expectation, that he findeth himſelf the firſt ſubject of his Couſens Juſtice, and highly reſenting his Kinſmans cruelty, whom he knew under pretext of Piety ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his own Revenges, reſolveth to prevent his miſchief. He had ſometime been familiar with Sir <hi>James,</hi> had known his by-paths; his ſecret Plots and airy brags had not eſcaped his obſervation; ſome alike in Kindred, to them both were emiſſaries ſuborned, to mark not only his actions but words and behaviour, by which one way or other he might be intrapt; He knew Sir <hi>James</hi> ſtood in ſome um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage with the King, and that ſome ſuſpitions by no Innocency could be taken away. When at laſt he had found his hot-ſpur Couſen (who threatned him with Death and Fire) within the circle of his conjurations, he directeth his Son to the King, who at that time was ready to paſs the <hi>Forth</hi> in his Barge; this baſhful Meſſenger giveth advertiſement from his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:175204:194"/>
Father, that the King ſhould make his Perſon ſure from his foes at home; for Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun</hi> had ſecret Intelligence and Plots with the Earl of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſs</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> and that he attended only the occaſion when he might ſurprize him, either alone, or with a mean Retinue, and then or openly he would invade him, or breaking up his Chamber-doors aſſaſſinate him. The King giving attentive ear to a buſineſs which concerned him, no leſs than the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Perſon, the accuſation being given by a Couſen of the ſuſpect, againſt a Family, which a little diſorder in the State might turn Succeſſors to the Crown, directeth the young man to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> and beyond his private inſtructions giveth him a Ring (well known by the chief Officers to be a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of power and ſecrecy) to aſſemble ſo many of the Counſel as were reſident. Sir <hi>Thomas Areskin,</hi> Secretary, Sir <hi>James Lermound,</hi> Maſter of the Houſhold, <hi>William Kircaldie</hi> Treaſurer and others, meet, fear, conſult upon the Treaſon, labour how to prevent it; come to Sir <hi>James</hi> his Lodging, make ſure his Perſon in the Caſtle of <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> and at that ſame time proceed, according to the Kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to inſtruct his Proceſs. Sir <hi>James</hi> paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſenting his impriſonment, by his Friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploreth the aid of the Church-men upon his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. They apprehending his accuſation to be a Stratagem of State forg'd by theſe of the Reformed Religion, for the ſtopping any further progreſs of the Inquiſition, already ſo furiouſly begun, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their credit with the King for his Liberty to the diſcharging of his Commiſſion againſt Hereticks. If the King ſhould hearken to every Informer againſt a man in State and Office, he ſhould never have an end; for thus no man is ſo innocent who may not be detracted and calumniated. Sir <hi>James</hi> was
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:175204:195"/>
known to be a man raſh and inſolent in words, his Brains having been a little giddy (like one looking from a great height) by his advancement in honours and place in Court; but ſincere in the ſervice of his Prince and loyal. If he was arrogant in boldneſs of terms, that was to acquire ſome more credit with the Commons, that he might do better ſervice to his Prince.</p>
               <p>They who committed Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun,</hi> knowing the King facile and eaſie to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Clergy, ſome of them too, profeſſing or giving way to the Reform'd Religion, reſolve (if he ſhould eſcape free of this accuſation) that an imminent ruine hung over their Perſons and Eſtates. Neceſſity and fear combining the diſtracted powers of their minds, they come, proſtrate before the King, beſeech him not ſo much to look to the quality and circumſtances of the Crime, as to the evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the man, who, powerful, factious, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally vindicative, would never forgive nor forget the danger he was driven unto; that his Majeſty would conſider his paſs'd life, terrible and cruel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all whom he could over-reach; That to give him liberty, and relieve him of his impriſonment, before the Crimes of which he was accus'd were clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved, or not, would be their, and the accuſers overthrow; whom they eſteemed loyal Subjects, and except upon evident probabilities, had never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven informations againſt him. That he was a man perfectly hated of the People, and a more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſacrifice could not be offer'd unto their fury it he prov'd guilty. At their Supplications the King gave the Judges full power to proceed againſt him, and adminiſter Juſtice according to their Conſciences and the Laws of the Kingdom. The pannal being found guilty of ſuch points of the Indictment as was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:175204:195"/>
him, was condemned to die, and thereafter accordingly beheaded, his Quarters being ſet aloft on the Town gates his Lands annexed to the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Crimes of which he was found guilty (as from thoſe who lived near that time have by tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been received) were, he had intelligence with the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> and <hi>Dowglaſſes,</hi> whom he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have reſtored, though with the Kings death, he had a plot to have broken up the Kings Chamber-doors, and killed him, devolving the title of the Crown, or at leaſt Government of the Kingdom to his kindred. Being directed to have repaired a Caſtle in Bute, and to this effect receiving three thouſand Crowns in <hi>April,</hi> he went not thither, attending ſome change in the State, which was to be accompliſhed by treaſon againſt the Kings perſon. He kept ſtill with him men of deſperate minds and fortunes who at his direction durſt enterprize any miſchief.</p>
               <p>Where he had repaired ſome of the Kings houſes, he had placed a Statue reſembling himſelf, or which to ſome he had named his Statue (what Mole hills are turned into Mountains when a Prince will pry into the actions of a diſgraced Subject?) above the Kings arms. He had detracted from his Maſter, nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the King of Clowns and Prieſts, and Scourge of the antient Nobility; He had laboured to hinder the Kings marriage at his being in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe points the people (who rejoiced in his ruin) added, he had ſlain cruelly the Earl of <hi>Lennox</hi> at the battel of <hi>Lithgow,</hi> after he was Priſoner to <hi>Purdowye;</hi> he had way-laid <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> who was killed by his direction and Councel.</p>
               <p>This back-blow of Fortune proveth, that it is dangerous once highly to offend a Prince, and after remain in his ſervice; for Princes put old offences up as neglected, and when the occaſion ſerveth
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:175204:196"/>
them, ſurprize long after the Delinquents for ſome faults for which they are ſcarce guilty.</p>
               <p>Sundry of the Nobility, appall'd at this ſudden fall of Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun</hi> (for though they loved not the Man, they hated the examples of ſuch ſtrict Juſtice) left the Court, retiring to their own dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes: which made the King ſuſpitious of them and believe they favoured the reformed Religion, and preferred the friendſhip of King <hi>Henry</hi> his Uncle to his. Neither was he herein far Miſtaken: for ſome feared not to ſend him word, that they had learned the Church-men had ſet him on work to extirpate his antient Nobility, as if it were an eaſie matter to create as many out of the Gentry, in whom (being his own Creatures) he might have greater confidence than any made by his Predeceſſours.</p>
               <p>After this he turned ſo retired, ſullen and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that every thing diſpleaſed him, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came even inſupportable to himſelf. not ſuffering his Domeſtick Servants to uſe their ordinary diſport and recreations near him. And as all day he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and figured to himſelf new cares to perplex himſelf, ſome of which might fall forth, others could never come to paſs; So in the night time the objects of his dayly projects of working upon his fantaſie, limmed their dark ſhadows of diſpleaſures; which gave him terrible affright in his ſleep. Amongſt many of which, two are recorded as notable; one in the Hiſtory of the Church, the other common; both ſeem to have been forged by the Men of thoſe times, who thought fictions as powerful to breed an opinion in diſcontented minds as verities, and they may challenge a place in the poetical part of Hiſtory. As he lay in the Pallace of <hi>Lithgow</hi> about the midſt of the night, he leaped out of his Bed, called for Lights, commandeth his Servants to ſearch <hi>Thomas
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:175204:196"/>
Scot</hi> his Juſtice Clark, who (he ſaid) ſtood by his Bed-ſide accompanied with hideous weights curſing the time that ever he had ſerved him; for by too great obedience to him, he was by the juſtice of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to everlaſting torments.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they about him laboured to cure his wounded Imagination, news came that <hi>Thomas Scot</hi> about the ſame hour of the Night was departed to the other World at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and with no better Devotion than he was repreſented to the King.</p>
               <p>After Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun</hi> had ended his part of this Tragicomedy of life, he ſeemed to the King to have returned on the Stage and in a ghaſtly manner with a naked Sword in his hands, he thought he parted both his arms from him, advertiſing him he would come again ſhortly, and be more fully reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, till which occaſion he ſhould ſuffer theſe wounds. The next day after this viſion (which is recorded to have been the ſeventh of <hi>Auguſt</hi>) word came that both his Sons were deceaſed and that almoſt in one hour. <hi>James</hi> the Prince (then one year old) at St. <hi>Andrews, Arthur</hi> one moneth old at <hi>Sterlin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> finding himſelf diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Nephew of their meeting, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to have been occaſioned by the Rhetorick and liberality of the Churchmen: having many of the Nobility of <hi>Scotland</hi> of his faction (whoſe innocency interpreted his Religion to be the reformed, though indeed it was of his own ſtamp, for he aboliſhed the Pope but not Papacy) by making prizes of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Ships upon the Seas with his Fleet, and incurſions of his garriſon'd Souldiers upon land beginneth the prologue of an unneceſſary war.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Engliſh</hi> incurſions placeth <hi>George Gordoun</hi> Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> with his full power and authority at the Borders, and directeth <hi>James
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:175204:197"/>
Lermound</hi> of <hi>Darcey,</hi> towards his Uncle, to give ſufficient reaſons of his not meeting him at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> withal to ſeek reſtitution of his Ships, ſith taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any lawful War was proclaimed, and to expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulate the hoſtility of the Borderers.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry not only</hi> refuſeth to render the Ships, or give a reaſon for the breaking forth of the Garriſons on the Borders, but delaying the anſwer of the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Embaſſadour upon advantage of time, ſendeth Sir <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> ſeconded with the Earl of <hi>Anguſs</hi> and Sir <hi>George Dowglaſs,</hi> in hoſtile manner to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Scotland.</hi> Theſe to the number of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, burn, ſpoil ſmall villages, and ravage the Country near the debatable bounds. The Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> omitteth no occaſion to reſiſt them, places garriſons in <hi>Kelſo</hi> and <hi>Jedburgh,</hi> aſſembling all the hardy Borderers, and invadeth the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh</hi> forces at a Place named <hi>Hall-dan rig;</hi> here it is ſoundly skirmiſhed, till the Lord <hi>Hume</hi> by the advancing of four hundred freſh Launces turned the fortune of the Day; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were put to flight; the Warden Sir <hi>Robert Bowes</hi> Captain of <hi>Norham,</hi> Sir <hi>William Mowbray, James Dowglaſs</hi> of <hi>Parkhead</hi> with the natural Son of the Earl of <hi>Anguſs,</hi> were taken Priſoners (the Earl by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his horſe eſcaping) with others to the number of ſix hundred. The Warden ſtaied in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> till the Kings death.</p>
               <p>This Road happened proſperouſly to the <hi>Scots</hi> the 24 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1541. being a Diſe-mall St. <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The War continuing till Midſumer, King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent the Earl of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> whom he named the Rod of the <hi>Scots,</hi> with great power towards <hi>Scotland;</hi> with him the Earls of <hi>Shrewsbury, Derby, Camberland, Surrey, Hereford, Anguſs, Rutland,</hi> and the Lords
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:175204:197"/>
of the North parts of <hi>England,</hi> with an Army of fourty thouſand men, as they were eſteemed. With them he directeth <hi>James Lermound</hi> of <hi>Darcey</hi> the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Embaſſadour to keep an equal march till they came to <hi>Berwick</hi> and there to ſtay that he ſhould not give advertiſement to his Maſter of any of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, the Earl of <hi>Huntley</hi> upon advantages of places reſiſting the adventuring Routs who eſſayed to croſs the <hi>Tweed.</hi> But King <hi>James</hi> hearing the old Duke of <hi>Norfork</hi> was their Leader, raiſeth from all the parts of his Kingdom Companies, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them upon <hi>Sawtery-edge</hi> muſtered thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men. They encamped on <hi>Falla-Moor,</hi> the King having advertiſement that the Duke would march towards <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> Ten thouſand ſtrong, the Lords <hi>Hume, Seatoun, Areskin,</hi> to make up the Earl of <hi>Huntleys</hi> forces, are ſent towards the borders: The King himſelf expecting the Artillery and other furniture of War ſtaieth with the body of the Army in the Camp. During this time it is reported the Lords plotted a Reformation of the Court, according to the example practiſed at <hi>Lawder-Bridge:</hi> eſpecially againſt ſuch who were named, Penſioners of the Prieſts; but becauſe they could not agree, among themſelves about thoſe who ſhould ſtretch the ropes, every one ſtriving to ſave his kinſman, or friend, they eſcaped all the danger.</p>
               <p>That this attempt being revealed to the King, he diſmiſt ſome of his favourites in great fear to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</hi> So malitious is faction armed with power.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by ſuch in the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Camp who favoured King <hi>Henry,</hi> having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the preparation and mind of King <hi>James</hi> to meet him in an open field, well knowing that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had that much of a woman to favour young men more than old, and that honourable retreats are
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:175204:198"/>
no waies inferiour to brave Charges, retireth off the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ground, and keeps his Forces on their own Marches. For the valour and reſolution of this young Prince might (perhaps) ſpoil and diveſt him of his former purchaſed Lawrels and Palms, to the applauſe of King <hi>Henry,</hi> who, ſome thought (being weary of his ſervice) to this effect ſent him to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> A great number of the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> and <hi>North-Humbrians,</hi> who, upon hopes of ſpoil, had followed him, pretending want of Victuals, and the rigorous ſeaſon of the year, with Arms and Baggage leave this Army. Having done little harm to the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſuffered much hunger and cold at <hi>Berwick,</hi> he prepareth a retreat towards <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When King <hi>James</hi> underſtood the Duke had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the <hi>Tweed,</hi> he encouraged his Army to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. The Common Souldier was indifferent; the Noblemen refuſe to fight except upon <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ground. The King urgeth them with the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and advantage of a Revenge of the old wrong of the Duke, commanding an Army neither of the Gentry, nor many Nobles of <hi>England,</hi> but of Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and preſſed Artizans, whoſe number would prove hurtful to themſelves, and turn them in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered confuſion. They had many days ſuffered famine, and all neceſſities of War; their vigour and courage was ſpent; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fought far off, and they at home. There wanted not matter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but a man to deliver the King an anſwer; generally they refuſe to fight. To defend the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Prince, the State and Countrey, they would hazard their lives, and if they had any thing more dear. If the Enemy would ſtay on <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ground, they would do their uttermoſt to make him retire, or by main force expel him; But to invade <hi>England</hi> and tempt an Army, who not only was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:175204:198"/>
but returned to their own bounds, they neither had ſo juſt a quarrel as they wiſht, nor were they ſufficient at that time to purſue them. Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for War were ſpent, the Winter approached, Victuals conſumed: that deſpair often turned it ſelf into true fortitude, and men in good Order retiring would not be too near followed, that even flying Enemies ſhould have Bridges of Gold. Now if they were to charge the Enemy they would not have the Kings preſence, a man young, raſh, valorous, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe life, not only the glory of the Battel, but the life of the Common-wealth depended, his two Sons being lately departed. For if the fortune of War brought a period to his life, the Crown would remain at the mercy of the Victor; that the Kings glory was not little that he had in ſo ſhort a time with ſo ſmall Forces, and theſe ſuddenly gathered, ſtopt the progreſs of ſo mighty an Army, which was ſo long in gathering, and boaſted of ſuch great matters, yet which durſt not advance one mile in <hi>Scottiſh</hi> ground. Whether the <hi>Engliſh</hi> fly or retire, they had ſuffered as much wrong as they had done, and now to fight them (and that perhaps) with diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, was to put in hazard what was already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> returning to <hi>London,</hi> the King with his Army cometh to <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> which immediately he disbanded; but he forgot not the ſecret Plot againſt his Favourites, nor the open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of his Nobles to fight on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground: as if the Earth were not all one piece and Matter, and men the deſtinade inhabitants of it every where; the Cardinal <hi>David Beatoun, Oliver Saintclair, Craggy Roſs,</hi> and others add fewel to theſe flames, <hi>Falla-Moor</hi> Plot mightily inſtigating them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:175204:199"/>The King avouched publickly, That the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity neither loved his honour, nor deſired his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance amongſt them.</p>
               <p>To cool theſe ſmoaking humors and breed in the King fairer hopes of his Nobles, the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> offereth, giving him ten thouſand men to command (if the State thought it expedient) to invade <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at <hi>Salloway,</hi> affirming the State and fortune of thoſe who aſſail, to be better than theirs who are ſtill put to their defence. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces being divided, he doubted not to ſtay longer on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground than the Duke had done on the <hi>Scottiſh,</hi> and to effectuate ſomething to the Kings content. The King thanking him for his offer, appointeth a Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous to be at the Weſt Marches. No Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations are divulged for the Levies of men, but cloſe Letters ſent.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal and the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> (the one a Church-man of a mind above many Nobles, the other a Nobleman of an humility under any Church-man) to give falſe perſpective to thoſe proceedings, by ſound of Trumpets, and beating of Drums raiſe men openly, march toward <hi>Hadingtoun,</hi> and the Eaſt-Borders; Whilſt the Earls of <hi>Caſſiles, Glencaris,</hi> Lords <hi>Flammin, Sommervail, Areskin,</hi> Barons <hi>Aytoun, Langtoun, Ormeſtoun, Waughtoun,</hi> and many others, accompanied with the Kings domeſtick Servants ride to the Weſt Borders.</p>
               <p>The night before the Road, the King himſelf came to <hi>Loch-Maban,</hi> attending the event of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion. Companies comming from all quarters of the Countreys about, none knowing of another, with the power of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Borderers, paſs the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Esk,</hi> burn certain <hi>Hamlets</hi> of the <hi>Grahams</hi> on the very limits.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:175204:199"/>Sir <hi>Thomas Whartoun</hi> Warden of theſe Marches, not a little troubled at ſuch a frequent aſſembly of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Riders, raiſing the power of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, placeth them by a hill, where he might take a view of their Forces, in good order; with him were Baſtard <hi>Dacres</hi> and <hi>Jack Muſgrave;</hi> two va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captains.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Lords beholding the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> range themſelves in a Battalion, deſire to know the Kings Lieutenant-General, for now it was to Marſhal their Companies, and every man to take him to his Charge. Preſently <hi>Oliver Saintclair</hi> upon, croſſed Pikes is mounted, the Kings Banner diſplayed, and the Commiſſion read in which he is deſigned Lieutenant, and all commanded, in the Kings name, to obey and follow him.</p>
               <p>It hath been reported by thoſe who were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Oliver,</hi> that the Commiſſion was not read, but that at his very ſight ſuch a tumult, confuſed clamour, and enter ſhouldering of Male contents aroſe, their Ranks were broken, the Military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der turned into a confuſion, none ſo repining as the Lord <hi>Maxwel</hi> and the Borderers; Who if he had patience to have heard the Commiſſion (as <hi>Oliver</hi> proteſted) was Lieutenant, and not he, whoſe charge was only to preſent it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> who now were ready for the Fight, obſerving this diſorder, take the advantage upon the occaſion, and brake forwards with a military ſhout, whilſt the others are in doubt whether to flee or ſtand, and the Guidiats and Scullons are peſle meſle thronging with the foot Soldiers and they with the Horſemen. Here is a general ſurprize, moſt part willingly rendring themſelves to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> without any ſhew of defence, or the ſlaughter of any perſon of any ſide. This overthrow proveth
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:175204:200"/>
that neither arms nor the multitude and numbers of Souldiers without their love and hearts availeth any thing in a Field, yea rather they are hurtful the more in number they be, if their affection be alienated from their Commanders.</p>
               <p>It is recorded that at this road, which was named <hi>Solloway-Moſs,</hi> every <hi>Engliſh</hi> had three or four <hi>Scots</hi> for Priſoners, and when their wanted men to take them; the women of the neighbouring Hamelet and Boys had Priſoners; the Earls of <hi>Caſſiles</hi> and <hi>Glencarn,</hi> the Lords <hi>Maxwel, Flamin, Sommervail, Olivant, Gray, Robert Areskin</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Areskin, Oliver Saintclair;</hi> The Lairds of <hi>Craggy, Aytoun, Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun, Ormeſtoun, Waughtoun,</hi> many of the Kings Domeſtick Servants were taken Priſoners, brought to <hi>London,</hi> and remained there till after the Kings death.</p>
               <p>The certainty of this voluntary defeat coming to the King at <hi>Loch-Maban</hi> (or <hi>Carlawfroke</hi> as others) ſo aſtoniſhed all the powers of his mind that he neither had counſel nor reſolution what to follow, neither remembring his own valour, nor the number of his Subjects yet flouriſhing; he remained as one diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and abandoned of all hopes. The Plot of the Nobles at <hi>Falla-Moor</hi> againſt his Servants, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to give battel on <hi>Engliſh</hi> ground, made him apprehend that the whole body of his Nobility had conſpired his overthrow.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal and Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> coming to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> he alſo returned; all ſo caſt down that they were aſhamed to come within ſight of each other ſome daies.</p>
               <p>After which, in a retired manner, he paſſed to <hi>Fyffe,</hi> and from <hi>Hall-yards</hi> to <hi>Faulkland,</hi> where he gave himſelf over to Sorrow, No man had acceſs unto him, no, not his own Domeſticks. Now are his thoughts buſied with revenge, now with rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:175204:200"/>
his ſcornful Nobility: long watchings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall cares, and paſſions, abſtinence from food, and recreation, had ſo extenuated his body, that pierced with grief, anguiſh, impatience, deſpair, he remained fixt to his bed.</p>
               <p>In theſe Trances Letters come from <hi>Lithgow</hi> to him, That the Queen was delivered of a Daughter the eight of <hi>December.</hi> When he heard it was a Daughter was born, he is ſaid to have turned his face from them that read the Letters, and ſighing a farewell to the World, it will end as it began (ſays he) the Crown came by a Woman, and it will with one go; many miſeries approach this poor King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; King <hi>Henry</hi> will either make it his by Arms or Marriage.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal put in his hands ſome blank Papers, of which they compoſed a Letter Will, which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſubſcribed or not, is uncertain. After which he ſaid not many words which could be underſtood, but muſed on the diſcomfiture of his Servants at the <hi>Solloway-Moſs.</hi> In which fits he left this World the thirteenth of <hi>December</hi> 1542. the three and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year of his Age and two and thirty of his Reign.</p>
               <p>Some record he was troubled by an unkindly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and that the Cardinal was conſcious to it, but upon far conjectures: for the event proved that his death was not only the ruine of the Cardinal, but of the whole Church-men of the Kingdom, and frame of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. His Body was conveyed from <hi>Faulkland</hi> to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, Earls of <hi>Arran, Arguyl, Rotheſs, Marſhal,</hi> accompanying it; and in <hi>January</hi> buried in the Abby Church of <hi>Holy-rood-Houſe,</hi> near the Body of <hi>Magdalen</hi> his firſt Queen. He left behind him many natural Children; of his Marriages only one

Daughter, five days old at his death, the Heir of his Kingdom and misfortunes.</p>
               <p>This King was of a well made body and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mind, if it had been carefully poliſht; he was of a middle ſtature; Nature had given him ſtrength and ability equal to any; but by exerciſe he had ſo confirmed it, that he was able to endure any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and practiſe all feats af Arms, as his attending on Malefactors proved; for he was ordinary thought the firſt of his Troops who purſued them, and the laſt that left the chaſe, being daring and forward. In his private affairs he was attentive and liberal, yet ſpared his Treaſure that he ſhould not want, and when occaſion required, caring for no charges. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man did entertain Soveraignty more familiarly, being of eaſie acceſs to the meaner ſort as to the great. He was ſtudious of all good Arts, naturally given to Poeſie, as many of his Verſes yet extant teſtifie. He was of as great ſobriety as of little continency; he was a great favourer of learned men. The poor men loved him, the great feared him; he made the ruſhy buſhes keep the herds of Cattel; he was thankful towards his Friends, dangerous towards his Enemies. He infinitely obliged his People by eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a Juſtice Court among them, and bringing all ſorts of Manufactours from Neighbour Nations home. By the <hi>Germans</hi> he found the Gold Mines of <hi>Crawfoord</hi> Moor, being unknown to this part of the World before him, out of which he extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treaſure. He left his Arſenals furniſht with all ſorts of Arms and furniture for War. Now as in Pictures not only the light but the ſhadow is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, let us look upon him in all his umbrages. This Prince in his long purſuit of the <hi>Dowglaſſes</hi> ſeems to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had a ſtrange humor, that he could never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; And moſt of his miſeries may be traced to this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:175204:201"/>
                  <hi>Source;</hi> theſe he would have extirpate, and the King of <hi>England</hi> could not forſake a man who was his Brother-in-Law, and had been ever obſequious to him. Seeking only that he might be reſtored to his own, out of which he was caſt, not by any Treaſon or aſpiring to the Crown, but of an ambition he had to be near the King, and equal to any Subject: his own worth, Kindred and Followers animated him thereunto; having Married the Kings Mother and one of the greateſt Kings Siſter of thoſe times.</p>
               <p>The burning alive of the Lady <hi>Glames,</hi> behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Maſter of <hi>Forbeſs,</hi> and after him Sir <hi>James Hamiltoun,</hi> turned many of his Nobles from him, and made the Commons detract him. For though they delight ſometimes to have great men made equal to them, when they find not evident proofs and ſound grounds of their ſufferings and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, they abhor the Actors. Princes ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that as the People are their Subjects, ſo are they the Subjects of Time and Providence.</p>
               <p>This humor of revenge made many believe if he had not been prevented by death, many Scaffolds had been embrued for <hi>Falla-Moor</hi> Plot, and <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowny-Moſs.</hi> The Lord <hi>Maxwel,</hi> who had ſtudied the Character of the King, at that Road vowed (when he might have eſcaped among his known Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers) he would rather be the KING of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Priſoner, and ſee him at <hi>London,</hi> than return home, and be ſhamefully hanged at the Croſs of <hi>Edenburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſtudied very much the overthrow of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Nobility, not conſidering that the Titles of Crown in Hereditary Kingdoms belong only to Kings for that they are the moſt Ancient Noblemen, and alſo firſt of the Primitive Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:175204:202"/>In his laſt years he was altogether governed by <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prelates, dangerous Pilots in the Ocean of a troubled State; that Body in which one humour ſignorizeth, cannot laſt long, and a Prince periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when he is governed by only one ſort of men. Neither was he ruled ſo much by them out of great zeal to Religion (being a Prince altogether given to his own pleaſures) as that he found them coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe the Nobility, whilſt he ſwayed the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance.</p>
               <p>His death proveth his mind to have been raiſed to the higheſt ſtrain, and above mediocrity; for he could dye, but could not diſgeſt a diſaſter. He ſeemeth to have too much confidence in himſelf, and that he forgot the conditions of Mortality. Whilſt he ſuffered himſelf to be carried away by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of grief, and ſwallowed up in the gulf of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
               <p>All his faults are but ſome few Warts in a moſt pleaſing and beautiful Face.

that ſhould be as Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. In every caſe we ſhould take greater heed to what in it is hurtful, than to what is in it profitable; for what profit and commodity any thing carrieth with it, eaſily preſenteth it ſelf unto us; but any one point which may hurt us, unleſs it be obſerved and carefully taken away, may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and bring to nought all that hath been rightly intended.</p>
            <p>The reſtoring of the Earl <hi>Monteeth</hi> in blood, and allowing his deſcent and title to the Earldom of <hi>Strathern</hi> is thought to be diſadvantageous to the King's Majeſty, and that a more dangerous blow could not be given to the Nobleman himſelf. We may eaſily conjecture of things to come and imagine them by thoſe of the like nature which have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Stage of the World is the ſame ſtill, though in times the Actors be changed, and come about again.</p>
            <p>For the Kings Majeſty, it would be conſidered if <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth King of <hi>England</hi> would, if it had been in his power, reclaimed the approbation reſtoring in bloud and allowing of the deſcent and title of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who openly in Parliament thereafter made claim for the Crown, as in his own right, laying down thus his title.</p>
            <p>The Son of <hi>Ann Mortimer</hi> who came of <hi>Philipe</hi> the Daughter and ſole heir of <hi>Leonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son to King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by very good right in Succeſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before the children of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> the fourth Son of the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> the third: but <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> is come of <hi>Philipe</hi> the Daughter and ſole Heir of <hi>Leonel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son to K <hi>Edward</hi> the third, then to be preferred before the children of the fourth Son who was <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:175204:204"/>The like reaſon may be alledged in the Title of the Earl of <hi>Strathern.</hi> The children of a firſt marriage by the common Law are to be preferred in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion before the children of the ſecond marriage; for the marrying of <hi>Elizabeth Moor</hi> did but legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and make her children to ſucceed after the children of the firſt marriage.</p>
            <p>As for the authority of a Parliament, it would be conſidered, whether or not the Authority of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may confer and entail a Crown from the lawful Heir thereof, to the next apparent heirs. Or if an Oath given unto a King by mans Law ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it tendeth to the ſuppreſſion of Truth and Right which ſtand by the Law of God. Then if one Parliament hath power to entail a Crown, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may not another Parliament upon the like conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations reſtore the ſame to the righteous heirs.</p>
            <p>But the Subject reſigneth all his right to his King. It would be conſidered whether a ſubject may ſafely capitulate with his Prince, that is to ſay, give over and quit-claim all right and title which he hath to his Soveraigns Crown, his Right being ſufficient, and if by his capitulation his heirs be bound, and if it be honourable for a Prince to accept his conditions.</p>
            <p>The trouble which <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> raiſed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> is yet recent to the Readers of Hiſtories.</p>

            <p>It would likewiſe be conſidered if the Earl of <hi>Strathern,</hi> though a mean Subject, theſe two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, having been debarred from all title to the Crown, and now by the indulgency and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favour of the Prince, being reſtored to his deſcent in blood and ſerved Heir to his great Progenitors, and indirectly as by appendices to the Crown, if either out of diſpleaſure. or for want of means to maintain their eſtates, he or his ſhould ſell and diſpoſe their Rights and Titles of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſome mighty and Foreign Prince, ſuch as is (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this day the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>) who wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a title to invade a Kingdom, not knowing whither to diſcharge his victorious forces. It would be conſidered if that title diſpoſed to that Prince were ſufficient to make him King of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Or
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:175204:205"/>
if eſtabliſhing his right upon fair conditions, ſuch as is liberty of conſcience, abſolution and freedom from all taxes and ſubſidies, the transferring of Ward lands into fewd, the people of <hi>Scotland</hi> might give him their Oath of Allegiance; or if he might redact the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> to give him ſatisfaction and compound for his right of the Crown of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would to theſe be conſidered, If times ſhould turn away the minds of Subjects from their Prince, by ſuperſtition, ſedition and abſolute Rebellion, as what may not befall an inconſtant ever wavering Nation, to an <hi>Ariſtocratie, Oligarchy, Democratie,</hi> or abſolute <hi>Anarchy?</hi> If the Rebellious ſubjects and abuſed Populace might not make advantage of ſuch Men, who draw their titles from <hi>Evanders</hi> mother to trouble the preſent times.</p>

And here Sir, She offers by me to the Altar of your glory, whole Hecatombs of moſt happy deſires; praying all things may prove proſperous unto you; that every Virtue and Heroick Grace which make a Prince eminent, may with a long and bleſſed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment attend you. Your Kingdoms flouriſhing abroad with Bays, at home with Olives; preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you Sir, who art the ſtrong Key of this little World of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with thoſe keys which caſt up the Gates of her affection, and deſign you power to open all the ſprings of the hearts of thoſe her moſt Loyal Citizens.</p>
                        <p>Yet this almoſt not neceſſary; For as the Roſe at the fair appearing of the morning Sun, diſplayeth and ſpreadeth her purples; So at the very noiſe of your happy return to this your native Countrey; their hearts (if they could have ſhined through their breaſts) were with joy and fair hopes made ſpatious. Nor did they ever in all parts feel a more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table heat, than the glory of your preſence at this time darteth upon them.</p>

                           <pb n="358" facs="tcp:175204:207"/>The old forget their age and look freſh and young at the appearance of ſo gracious a Prince; the young bear a part in your Welcom, deſiring many years of life, that they may ſerve you long; all have more Joys than Tongues. For as the words of other Nations far go beyond and ſurpaſs the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their hearts; So in this Nation the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their hearts is far above all they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs by words.

                     <p>IN a time when men for reading of Papers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning State are challenged, it muſt be a great hazard to write them, and a greater to ſend them from home, and the moſt to ſend them to one ſo near the Helm as is your Lordſhip, who the next day (perhaps) may put in the Princes hands what is ſent him. And then, though what is ſet down may be free of great faults; yet muſt it paſs and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as it pleaſeth the Prince to conſtrue it. But
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:175204:207"/>
what <hi>Marius Geminus</hi> ſaid to <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> may be ſaid to King <hi>Charles; Caeſar, qui apud te audent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, magnitudinem tuam ignorant; qui non audent, humanitatem.</hi> And writing to your Lordſhip I know to whom I write. Thus the way of glory lying near the Gates of danger, I have adventured this ſheet of Paper of which I beſeech your Lordſhip to be both Judge and Patron.</p>
                     <p>What a noiſe hath been raiſed in this Countrey by proſecuting a piece of writing, ſuppoſed to be derogatory to the Honour of the Kings Majeſty! No times have been without ſuch men. Wiſe men keep their thoughts locked up in the Cabinets of their Breaſts, and ſuffer the faults of times patiently; Fools rail, cry out, but amend nothing. What ever advice hath been given for the putting of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers to the extremity of Law, I would ſay (with all humble reſpect to grave Stateſmen) that in a matter of a Calumny and reproach with Subjects, a Prince can do nothing more fitting his own fame and reputation, than to ſlight and contemn them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing nothing to him; and that 'twere better to neglect, than be too curious in ſearching after the Authors. So <hi>Theodoſius, Honorius Arcadius</hi> were wont to ſay, If any man ſpeak ill of the Emperour, if he do it of lightneſs, it is to be contemned; if of madneſs, to be pittied; if of injury to be remitted. And <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great uſed to ſay, <hi>Regium eſt benefacere &amp; male audire;</hi> or as <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth it, <hi>Regium eſt a quibus male audias, magis eſſe iis beneficum. Nero</hi> (otherwiſe a terrible Prince) when that Paſquil was given out againſt him?</p>

                     <p>He took no notice of it, followed not the Writers with any puniſhment, ſought them not, as ye find in <hi>Suetonius, Et quoſdam ad Judicem delatos ad Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum, affici graviore poena prohibuit.</hi> Writings which we ſcorn and make none account, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vaniſh and turn into nought. If we chafe and fret, it would appear that we have been therein touched, and vively ſee in them our own faults and miſdemeanor taxed and laid open.</p>
                     <p>If theſe Papers for the Kings honour were not to be ſeen and read, or if they did derogate to the fame of the Nobles, why were they not ſuppreſſed and hidden? But is this the way to ſuppreſs and hide them? To impriſon, arraign, baniſh, execute the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons near whom they are found? Or is it not rather to turn them a piece of the Story of the Time to make ſuch a noiſe about them, and by ſeeking to avoid the ſmoak to fall into the fire? What we would moſt evite and ſhun, to be the Authors to bring upon our own heads?</p>
                     <p>What gained Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the twenty three of her Reign, by cutting off the hands of <hi>Stubbes</hi> and <hi>Page</hi> on a Scaffold for writing that Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her Marriage with the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> ſave that out of horror of that new and unpractiſed pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the People acknowledged her to be the right and not uncertain Daughter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, and ſhe began to be feared, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was beloved of her Subjects? Whom a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fear they hate, and whom they hate they wiſh taken away. A Prince ſhould be more violent in
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:175204:208"/>
revenging other mens quarrels than his own. That unfortunate Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in the time of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, could make good uſe, againſt the Succeſſion of the Race of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in his Speech to the Commons of <hi>London,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring them of the ſtrange proceedings of King <hi>Edward</hi> againſt a Merchant named <hi>Burdet:</hi> who dwelling at the Sign of the Crown, and having ſaid to his Son, that after his death he would make him Heritor of the Crown, meaning his own Houſe, was for this Tale in four hours after quartered, which blot is eternally fixed to that Prince.</p>
                     <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, who had ever known that Paſquil againſt three of his Courtiers, <hi>Louell, Ratcliff,</hi> and <hi>Catsby,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>If his Tyranny had not been mightily extended againſt that poor Gentleman <hi>Collingburn</hi> the Maker of it? Ye will ſay, it is in a Princes power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch Papers by Authority; That is the only way to make all men ſeek them, and being found highly prize them. <hi>Tacitus</hi> telleth us of certain Verſes of <hi>Fabricius Viento</hi> againſt Church-men and Senators, which were condemned to be burnt; as long as the reading and finding of them was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, they were much ſought for, and with danger read: but being afterwards licentiate to be read, and the liberty of having them obtained, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and no man cared for them.</p>
                     <p>No Prince, how great ſoever, can aboliſh Pens, nor will Memorials of ages be extinguiſhed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent power; the poſterity rendring to every one, his due honour and blame. It is true that great men
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:175204:209"/>
ſhould direct their great care to Fame and hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dear unto them; and he who contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, neglecteth thoſe actions by which it is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: But it is pitty men ſhould be more careful and ſtudious of fame for times to come, in which they are not, than of honeſty in the preſent times in which they live.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it is great wiſdom in a Prince not to reject and diſdain them who freely tell him his duty, and open to him his miſdemeanours to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the ſurmiſes and umbrages of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Council for the amending diſorders, and bettering the form of his Government. As if a man ſhould tell King <hi>Charles,</hi> That there is none in all his Kingdoms here can reckon himſelf Lord of his own Goods amongſt ſo many Taxes and Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, ſo much pilling and polling. So that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is daily plucked and pilled from honeſt men to be laſhed out amongſt unthrifts, that as <hi>Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides</hi> writes of the great Plague in his time at <hi>Athens,</hi> Men ſeeing no hopes of ſafety ſpent all they had in one night: So the uncertainty of enjoying and holding what they have for the preſent draws the thrifty and unthrifty to one end, for no man being ſure of Lands, leſs of Moneys, every man is turned in a deſperate careleſneſs of his Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>As to tell him alſo about this Subject, who is the ſubject of this Letter, the People ſay, Kings ſeeking Treaſon ſhall find Land, and ſeeking Land ſhall find Treaſon. The denial of a Princes deſire was the deſtruction of an innocent <hi>Naboth;</hi> the voice of the People ſhould not be kept up from the Ears a Prince.</p>
                     <p>As to unfold to a King, if Uſury be not lawful at all (for it is againſt Nature that Money ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Money, and not tolerate by the Moſaical Law,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:175204:209"/>
and in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> cap. 18. v. 13. it is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the roaring ſins, ſuch as are Adultery and bloudſhed) it being a ſin in the perſons of ſubjects, it is a greater ſin in the perſon of a Prince; for any ſin is greater in the perſon of a Prince, than in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſubjects: As ſin was worſe and greater in Angels than men. Nothing is profitable to a Prince which is not joined with honour; and the State of Kings unleſs it ſtand in pureneſs and fidelity, it cannot ſubſiſt in power.</p>
                     <p>As to tell King <hi>Charles,</hi> what a ſtrange thing it is to ſwaer a man for the true value of his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Since the valuing of Subjects Lands and Rents, Rents were never leſs, nor the Lands worſe; a ſecret ſcourge of God having followed it, the Country ſcarce affording bread to the Labourers of it.</p>
                     <p>Remember <hi>Davids</hi> numbring the people. In the times of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>Regnante Cardin. Volſeio,</hi> this was held uncouth, ſtrange and terrible; and no wonder if men ſcare and ſtart at it now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Prince of ſo meek a Spirit, ſo innocently good: who preferreth peace before war, reſt before buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, honeſty before profit: None of all his kingdom, no, not one being more holy, more chaſte, nor a better man; in whom reigneth ſhamefaſtneſs and modeſty and patience, taking all worldly croſſes in good part: never gaping for glory, nor thirſting after riches: but only ſtudying the health of his ſoul, peace of his Kingdoms, and how to advance the holy Church, and reſtore her to her firſt Rents and integrity. But God knoweth what he hath predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and ordained for the Scourge of this Country, againſt whoſe Ordinance prevaileth no counſel.</p>
                     <p>A Prince ſhould be advertiſed that the hatred and diſtaſt of mens preſent eſtates and fortunes ſetteth
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:175204:210"/>
them on work and maketh them exceeding earneſt to ſeek novations; for finding themſelves plunged in the beggary of a miſerable eſtate, as many do believe, it turneth not them baſe, nor keepeth them under, but raiſeth in them a mad deſire to change their fortune; and this hath been the enſign of Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents to attempt and enterprize dangerous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for it hath often been found that nothing hath ſooner armed a people than poverty, and poverty hath never ſo often been brought upon a Nation by the unfruitfulneſs of the Earth, by diſaſters of Seas, and other human accidents, as by the Avarice of the Officers and Favourites of Princes; who are brought fooliſhly to believe that by tearing of the skins of the flock they ſhall turne the Shepherd rich. It is no property of a good Shepherd to ſhear often his flock, and ever to milk them. Nor is it of a Prince to gall and perpetually afflict a people by a terrible Exchequer. <hi>Brutorum ſe Regem facit qui premit ſuos.</hi> Now in ſuch Theams it were not evil for a Prince to read <hi>Jan Marianai</hi> and <hi>George Buchanans</hi> piece <hi>de jure Regni apud Scotos,</hi> for his own private and the publick good.</p>
                     <p>Princes have in their actions this diſadvantage, that in matters of wrong and injuries concerning their Subjects, though they ſometimes ſuffer, by reaſon of their power, being thought ſtronger, they are ever eſteemed to do the wrong, which ſhould move them to abſtain from all violent courſes, and think really their Subjects loſſes are their own.</p>
                     <p>Ye will then ſay, the caſe of Princes is pittiful if Writers of infamous Libels be not rigorouſly puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; without all queſtion the Law is juſt and neceſſary againſt them. But in ſome caſes good Princes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver follow the rigour and extremity of puniſhment ſet down by their Laws, no, not againſt the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:175204:210"/>
Subjects, and eſpecially when the caſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth their own particulars. There is much to be conſidered in the convoy of ſuch Libels: If they contain Truths there is ſmall wrong in ſuch papers, as to call <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a Sinner, <hi>Matthew</hi> a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, <hi>Thomas</hi> a Misbeliever, <hi>Paul</hi> a Perſecutor, <hi>Peter</hi> a Denyer of his Maſter, and the reſt fugitives from him, and theſe are to be ſlighted and paſt over, If they contain mixed truths and apparences, they may be neglected; If they admit no interpretation, but true and flat railing, then is a Princes patience to be tryed, and the Libel to be ſcorned. If they propound novelty and cauſes of ſedition upon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent grounds, they are to be anſwered, and by good reaſon to be overthrown. If they be preſented by way of Supplication for redreſſing of errors in the State, it is a queſtion whether they be Libels or not. That Supplication of <hi>Humphrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixt of <hi>England</hi> againſt the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> may have place amongſt Libels; for the King is taxed there of notable dotage. As that by the counſel of the Cardinal, he had ſet at Liberty the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> ſuffered his Jewels and houſhold-ſtuff to be ſold, granted the Cardinal a Charter of Pardon for taking up his Rents, which were ſufficient to have maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wars in <hi>France</hi> many years. The ſetting of the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> at liberty, againſt the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the great friend of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and many other points. Yet this being done by way of Supplication, for redreſs of wrongs in the State, he was not threatened for (perhaps) verity, but remitted to the Council, and what for fear, and what for favor (ſaith the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory) the whole matter was winked at touching the Duke, and nothing ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cardinal, <hi>Miſeria ſumma ubi de injuria conqueri pro delicto habetur.</hi>

They have often aſſembled the Kings Majeſties Subjects to the great charges and vain attendance of many Noblemen and Barons to ſee their paſſions put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They have buſied the Prince to condemn others by power (a Miniſter of their attempts) and not purge himſelf to poſterity; for ſuch a Paper ſhould have been anſwered by a Pen, not by an Ax. There is no Prince living, no, nor dead, but Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects have and do both write and ſpeak of after their fantaſies. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in a Letter to <hi>Tiberius, Noli in hac re indagare &amp; minium indignari queniquam eſſe qui de me loquatur male; ſatis eſt enim fi hoc habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ne quis malefacere poſſit.</hi> And <hi>Tiberius</hi> in the beginning of his Reign (though after he killed <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutius Codrus</hi> for words) was wont to ſay, <hi>in Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate libera linguam quoque liberam eſſe debere.</hi> Wiſe Princes have never troubled themſelves much about talkers; weak ſpirits cannot ſuffer the liberty of Judgments, nor the indiſcretion of Tongues. To ſtrive to reſtrain them is the work of buſie Bodies, who would fain have ſomewhat to do, but know not what, nor how to help <hi>Domitian</hi> to kill gnats with his Dagger; having won points and concluſions

heretofore in the State beyond their hopes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to foſter great and ſhameful hopes beyond the reach of all obtaining.

                     <p>WHen out of curioſity this laſt week I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred theſe large and ſpatious Galleries, in which the Fair of St. <hi>German</hi> is kept, and had viewed the diverſe Merchandize and Wares of the many nations at that Mart, above the reſt I was much taken with the daintineſs of the many Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicts there to be ſeen. The devices, Poſies, Ideas Shapes, Draughts, of the Artificers were various, nice, and pleaſant. Scarce could the wandring thought light upon any Story, Fable, Gayety, which was not here repreſented to the view. If <hi>Cebes</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> Philoſopher made a Table hung in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the Argument of his rare <hi>Moralities,</hi> and <hi>Jovius</hi> and <hi>Marini,</hi> the Pourtraicts in their <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries</hi> and <hi>Libraries</hi> the ſubject of ſome books; I was brought to think I ſhould not commit a great fault, if I ſent you for a token, from this Mart a Scantling of this Ware: which affordeth a like contentment to the Beholder and poſſeſſour.</p>
                     <p>The Pictures of the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> appeared in one Plate, thoſe of the Biſhops with the Triple Crowns in another, with thoſe of all the Kings and great Princes in <hi>Europe. Lucretia</hi> was ſhewing her bleeding breſt; on this Table <hi>Flora</hi> her bewitching Twins, on that not far from theſe, <hi>Mars</hi> is ſurprized by the <hi>Lemnian,</hi> and the Senate of the Gods are all
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:175204:216"/>
laughing; near by <hi>Jupiter</hi> is coming down in a Golden Showre in his <hi>Danaes</hi> lap. One would have wiſhed <hi>Argos</hi> his eyes to gaze on <hi>Hellen</hi> in the prime of her beauty, as when the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Youth ſtole her away, or <hi>Theſeus,</hi> in one place of the Table, and ſee her diſtilling tears for the ruin of <hi>Troy</hi> in another. The <hi>Agamemnon</hi> of <hi>Timantes</hi> at the ſacrifice of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione</hi> was here to be ſeen. And what did ſurpaſs that in Invention, a Painter had hidden the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the work of his Work, who having painted a Lady which had but one eye, he had ſet her face ſo cunningly that her one ſide appearing only to the view, left a deſire in the Beholder, to wiſh for the other, which one could not but imagine beautiful, at which ſhe ſeemed to ſmile. The Father of our Factions, <hi>Meonides</hi> himſelf, was here repreſented with cloſed eyes, and a long beard of the colour of the Night, to whom was the honour af <hi>Mantua</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, his head wreathed with Baies, his face was ſomewhat long, his cheeks ſcarce with a ſmall down diſcrying his Sex; that they might be known after ſo many years, the Crafts-man had ſet down, <hi>They were thus ſtanding in the</hi> Roman <hi>Capitol.</hi> The <hi>Cyprian</hi> Goddeſs was in divers ſhapes repreſented. The firſt was naked as ſhe appeared on the Hills of <hi>Ida,</hi> or when ſhe aroſe from her foamy Mother, but that ſhe ſhould not bluſh, the Painter had limmed her entring a Green Arbour, and looking over her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſo that there were only ſeen her back and face. Another had drawn her naked, her face, breſts, belly to the view expoſed, her blind child by her, but to cover that which delighted <hi>Mars</hi> ſo much, he made her arm deſcend to take hold on <hi>Cupid,</hi> who did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her. The third had drawn her lying on a Bed with ſtretched out arms, in her hand ſhe preſented to a young man (who was adoring her, and at whom
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:175204:216"/>
little Love was directing a Dart) a fair face, which with much ceremony he was receiving but on the other ſide, which ſhould have been the hinder part of that head, was the Image of death; by which <hi>mortality</hi> he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the others more than they did him by <hi>Art.</hi> It were to be wiſhed this picture were ſtill before the eyes of dolting lovers. On a Table there was a horſe tumbling on his back with his four feet towards the Heaven, which was thought to be <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſo fatal to his Maſters, being ſo proportionable and to the life painted, a <hi>German</hi> offered Gold for him, but he accuſed the Painter that he had not painted him running: which the Painter eaſily amended by turning up of the other ſide of the Table: ſo ſmall a diſtance is between the extremities of mortal things. So with little pains a countenance laughing is made to weep, and one weeping to laugh. Whoſe thoughts are ſo ſad and fixed to the cares of this World, which could not have been ſequeſtred for atime from them, and delighted with the aſpect of the countenances of the Ladies of the differing Climates of the Globe of this Earth, repreſented unto us as the blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſteriſms of Heaven? The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſeeming proud and diſdainful, but that her eye ſpoke ſomewhat elſe, and her pale colour approaching to aſhes, did ſhow ſhe harboured languiſhing perturbations. The <hi>French</hi> looking Courteous and toward, but ſuch courteſie and towardneſs ſeemed not to entertain baſe imaginations. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> mild and humble with ſuch eyes as <hi>Venus</hi> uſed to ſmile with in the daies of <hi>Homer.</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> Lady appeared the Nobleſt Lover, for ſhe neither thundered deſpair nor promiſed hope, yet did ſhe lend her ear to the ſoul-charming ſounds of a Lute. The <hi>Roman</hi> was almoſt naked from the waſt upwards, diſcovering the Siſtering Apples of her <hi>Breſt,</hi> and what might be, without a

bluſh, ſeen, which ſhould have rowſed old <hi>Neſtor.</hi> The <hi>Grecian</hi> reſembled <hi>Our Engliſh,</hi> but her face was more <hi>Round;</hi> She wore on her head a <hi>Garland,</hi> which made her look more <hi>Grave</hi> than the <hi>Others.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> differed little from the <hi>Roman,</hi> only She ſomewhat appeared more <hi>Thais</hi> like. The <hi>Mooriſh</hi> had her eyes black, rolling and wanton, and her face was as black as her eyes. Where (who would think it, ſave he who did ſee it?) by the comely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her face. Her ſhining hair enriched with Jewels, and her ears beautified with Gemms, ſhe was near as pleaſant (beauty muſtering it ſelf in blackneſs and a comely behaviour) as thoſe others of <hi>Europe.</hi> I had almoſt forgotten the <hi>Belgick</hi> and theſe neighbour Countries, in whom the pure natural colours of beauty appeared. The firſt to ſhow the lightneſs of her ſex, was all in Feathers, the others differed not much from her but was further off from <hi>Art,</hi> and looked more Countrey-like.</p>
                     <p>Not far from thoſe was <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> her hairs ſo covering her face that <hi>Lycophron</hi> might well know her. The <hi>Sybels</hi> by her ſighed out their Prophecies.</p>

poſtures of fighting and periſhing Souldiers with the ſcattered Oars, Planks and Enſigns, might have made ſome dream they were amidſt theſe though in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and on the Seas whilſt they were ſafe on ground.

                     <p>Now when I had conſidered all (for theſe Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries were a little All, if ye pleaſe) caſting mine eyes aſide I beheld on a fair Table the Pourtraicts of two which drew my thoughts to more ſeriouſneſs than all the other. The firſt clad in a Sky-coloured Mantle bordered with ſome red, was laughing, and held out his Finger by way of demonſtration in ſcorn to another in a ſable Mantle, who held his arms a croſs, declined his head pittifully and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhed tears. The one ſhewed that he was <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,</hi> the other that he was <hi>Heraclitus.</hi> And truely conſidering all our actions except thoſe which the Service and Adoration of God Almighty, they are either to be lamented or laughed at, and man is

always a Fool, except in Miſery, which is a Whit-Stone of Judgment.</p>

                     <p>IT is more praiſe-worthy in Noble and excellent things to know ſomething, though little, than in mean and ignoble matters to have a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Amongſt all thoſe rare Ornaments of the mind of Man, <hi>Poeſie</hi> hath had a moſt eminent place, and been in high eſteem, not only at one time, and in one Climate, but during all times and through thoſe parts of the World where any ray of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and civility hath ſhined. So that ſhe hath not unworthily deſerved the name of the Miſtreſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, the height of Eloquence, the quinteſſence of knowledge, the loud Trumpet of Fame, the Language of the Gods. There is not any thing endureth longer: <hi>Homers Troy</hi> hath outlived many Republicks, and both the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Grecian</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies; ſhe ſubſiſteth by her ſelf; and after one demeanour and continuance her beauty appeareth to all ages. In vain have ſome men of late (Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of every thing) conſulted upon her Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and endeavoured to abſtract her to <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Ideas,</hi> and <hi>Scholaſtical Quiddities,</hi> denuding her of her own habits, and thoſe Ornaments with which ſhe hath amuſed the World ſome thouſand years. <hi>Poeſie</hi> is not a thing that is yet in the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearch, or which may be otherwiſe found
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:175204:220"/>
out, being already condeſcended upon by all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as it were eſtabliſhed <hi>jure Gentium,</hi> amongſt <hi>Greeks, Romans, Italians, French, Spaniards.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that a good Piece of <hi>Poeſie,</hi> which <hi>Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Petrarch, Bartas, Ronſard, Boſcan, Garcilaſſo</hi> (if they were alive) and had that Language, could not underſtand, and reach the ſence of the Writer. Suppoſe theſe men could find out ſome other new <hi>Idea</hi> like <hi>Poeſie,</hi> it ſhould be held as if Nature ſhould bring forth ſome new <hi>Animal,</hi> neither Man, Horſe, Lyon, Dog, but which had ſome Members of all, if they had been proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and by right Symmetry ſet together. What is not like the Ancients and conform to thoſe Rules which hath been agreed unto by all times, may (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) be ſomething like unto <hi>Poeſie,</hi> but it is no more <hi>Poeſie</hi> than a Monſter is a man. Monſters breed admiration at the firſt, but have ever ſome ſtrange loathſomneſs in them at laſt. I deny not but a <hi>Mulet</hi> is more profitable than ſome Horſes, yet is it neither Horſe nor Aſs, and yet it is but a Mulet. There is a Tale told of a poor miſerable Fellow accuſed of Beſtiality; and he at his <hi>Arraignment</hi> confeſſed, That it was not out of any evil intention he had done it, but only to procreat a Monſter, with which (having nothing to ſuſtain his life) he might win his bread going about the Countrey. For the like cauſe it may be thought theſe men found out their new <hi>Poeſie</hi> differing from the Matters, Manners, Rules of former ages; either they did not ſee the way of <hi>Poeſie</hi> or were afraid to enter it. The Verſes of <hi>Camillus Quernus</hi> as they are imitated by <hi>Strada</hi> ſeem very plauſible and to admiration to ſome, but how far they are off right <hi>Poeſie</hi> Children may gueſs. Theſe mens new conceptions approach nearer his, than to the Majeſty and Statelineſs of the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:175204:221"/>
great Poets. The contempt and undervaluing of Verſes hath made men ſpare their travel in adorning them; but <hi>Poeſie,</hi> as it hath overcome ignorance, at laſt will overcome envy and contempt. This I have been bold to write unto you, not to give you any inſtruction, but to manifeſt mine obedience to your requeſt.</p>

                     <p>MY ſilence this time paſt proceeded no waies of any forgetfulneſs of you, but from my many new cares, and ſorrows. The loſs of ſo many friends this ſeaſon, hath eſtranged me from my ſelf, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my mirth into mourning; what civil arms and diſcord have performed in other kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> a ſtill mortality hath done in this. So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Funerals theſe many years have not been ſeen as in this one. There are few bands of kindred, ſocieties, acquaintances, friendſhip, which by death are not broken here, without reſpect of Age, vigour, rank, quality; and juſtly this mortality might claim the name of Peſtilence, if the Dead were deprived of cuſtomary burial. Well have ſome Aſtrological Divines gueſſed that this year ſhould be the great Judgment. What is recorded of the years 100. and 120. that Church-yards were not ample enough to contain the dead bodies, but that new ground was digged up, is true in this; and what of the year 1348. that the third of mankind was ſweeped from the Earth: we may ſay that though this Country hath not loſt the third, yet that the Almighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:175204:222"/>

                     <p>IT is much argued amongſt thoſe men, who will have a reaſon of every thing, why good men ordinarily are deſerted of Fortune, and many evils ariſe to preferments. The firſt anſwer is, that lewd, bold men have ſtrong fantaſies, and attempt upon many divers matters, which good men by their baſhfulneſs and towardneſſe never eſſay to reach. The next anſwer is, That lewd men ſuffer themſelves to be guided by nature, or the ſtarry influences, or rather (being Fools) give themſelves over (like Beaſts) to be carried by their appetites, and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous are led by reaſon which often contrachecketh it ſelf, and by long meditation and advice what

                     <p>THis is no ſmall Miſery of us Iſlanders that, as exiled, we cannot take a view of Gods fair and ſpacious Earth without croſſing the ſtormy, brak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deceitful Seas; And it is no leſs a miſery here in this part of our Iſland, that can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair unto you <hi>demi-Islanders</hi> without dancing and toſſing on your arm of Sea; of all paſtimes and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes I like ſailing worſt, and had rather attend the Hunters and Faulkoners many daies, ere I ſailed one half day. It is a part of <hi>Noahs</hi> Judgment: If it ſhall be my good fortune to arrive in your Iſland, prepare no games of ſtrength for our recreation, and after a ſatiety of diſcourſe and reading, let us not trouble our ſelves with any ſedentary paſtimes; the Dies are for the end of a Drum amongſt Souldiers, the Tables for Goutiſh and apoplectick perſons to
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:175204:224"/>
make them move their joints; the Cards for women to obſerve their diſcretion. But if we ſhall have a deſire of change of thoughts, let us not refuſe the Cheſſe, the only Princely Game (next Government) in the World, yea the true Image and Pourtraict of it, and training of Kings. Here is a King defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a Lady, two Biſhops, two Knights, at the end of the Liſts, with two Rocks, Fortreſſes, or Caſtles. Before thoſe to prepare and make plain the paſſages, march eight Pawns, <hi>Enfantes perdues</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all deſperate Services, every one ſtanding for their <hi>Monarch.</hi> The Deviſer of this would repreſent unto us a game of State. Firſt for the Biſhops; that neareſt to Kings ſhould be Eccleſiaſtical grave Men, who by oblique, traverſe and myſtical ways (ſuch is their paſſage) ſhould effectuate their Maſters deſigns and ſafety. Though the Knights be not alwaies neareſt to the Kings, it falleth forth that even as the Knights at Game of Cheſſe by their leap, giving an Eſcheke to their Kings, the Kings are conſtrained to change places, from which by covering and overſhadowing themſelves with ſome other piece, in any other eſchekes they may eſcape free and exempted. So there is no danger in the State a King ſhould ſo much fear as the revolt of his Nobles. For the Towers or Caſtles named Rooks, theſe are the walled Towns, which ſerve for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the conſervation of the Kingdom. Here is a King reſembled who marcheth but one pace, whilſt all the other Pieces of the Cheſſe boord put themſelves now on the offenſive, then on the defenſive, for his ſafety. To teach Kings that it is not for them upon whoſe life the peace and happineſs of the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects rely, to expoſe themſelves every ſhock and hazard of battel, as a Captain. Sith for the ſafety of the King, he may make an extraordinary leap from his
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:175204:225"/>
own ſtation to the ſtation of the Rock or Tower, as to a Fortreſs holdable and impregnable againſt the greateſt aſſaults of his Enemies. The privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lady is conſiderable, ſhe may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times progreſs on the ways of the Biſhops, then on thoſe of the Rooks and Towers, only ſhe is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and inhibited from the leap skip bound of the Knights, as a thing undecent: Though <hi>Plato</hi> in his Republick permitteth Women to fight. The Game is concluded with the Mate of the King, that is a Fool or Madman in the <hi>Italian.</hi> If the other pieces keep not themſelves, they may, as dead, be taken and removed off the Cheſs-boord, but the King by loſs of men loſeth not the victory, he may by a hazard carry it with the meaneſt of his pieces, as his Army is wiſely and warily conducted. The King receiveth not that diſgrace in imagination as that they dream of his taking, but is enough that they bring upon him ſuch confuſion and diſarray, that blocked up and denuded of all ſupport he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not march to any Hold or Station. Which brought to paſs, we tell he is mated, that is, either mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or fool. To ſignifie what diſaſter ſo ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall a King we ſhould not attempt on his perſon. Moreover, even in the midſt and throng of all his beſt pieces the mating of the King is the concluſion of the Game; which ſhews us that on the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or overthrow of our King the overthrow or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our State dependeth. The recompence of the Pawns is not to be forgotten. When they can win and aſcend the furtheſt part of the Cheſs-bord on the Sunny ſide, as the firſt which mount a breach, in this caſe they are ſurrogated in thoſe void Rooms of the pieces of honour, which becauſe they ſuffered themſelves to be taken, were removed off the Boord, which in effect is to repreſent the puniſhment and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:175204:225"/>
guerdon due in a Commonwealth to good or evil actions. The Game ended, Kings, Queens, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Knights, Pawns, peſlemelled are confuſedly thrown in the box, the concluſion of all earthly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and greatneſs. If <hi>Hieronymus Vida</hi> can be found with <hi>Baptiſta Marini</hi> his <hi>Adone,</hi> we ſhall not ſpare ſome hours of the night and day at their Cheſs, for I affect that above the other; and here have we plaied without a Cheſs-boord on paper for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to our meeting.</p>

                     <p>I Never found any greater folly in the actions of Men than to ſee ſome buſie themſelves to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the accidents to come of their lives; this knowledge of things to come not revealed to us, is no ways needful for us. Whereſoever this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition is once received, Men are driven, and, as it were haunted with Furies, and are deprived of all calmneſs, quietneſs and reſt. I never knew any who had recourſe to thoſe unlawful curioſities who liv'd the ordinary age of man. God omnipotent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving his Grace from them giveth them over to fall under the Fate of their own fears. By the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and violent deſire of him who inquireth to know theſe things, <hi>Aſtrological</hi> Predictions come to paſs, not by the nature of the things themſelves, which are fortuital events, and have no natural cauſes, being voluntary. The miſtakings and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties or theſe Predictions, ſhould make us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn them, <hi>Aſtrologi fingunt non docent.</hi> The truth of <hi>Aſtrological Predictions</hi> is not to be refer'd to the conſtellations of Heaven, the <hi>Genethliaticks</hi> have other obſervations than the Stars; they conjecture by the diſpoſition, temper, complexion of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by the phyſiognomy, age, parents, education, acquaintance, familiarity, converſation, out of all which they collect many apparences, poſſibilities, likelihoods: and their prophecies are refer'd <hi>ad Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,

                     <p>But all thoſe events which <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> aver to come are fortuital and caſual contingents, then they cannot be learned or known by any precepts of Art. How can a <hi>Caldean</hi> by that ſhort minute, inſtant, moment of time in which a man is born, ſet down the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe changes, mutations, accidents of his life? If we were to conſider of thoſe things, it would appear we ſhould not be ſolicitous ſo much, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how the air is affected at the infants coming in this World, as we ſhould obſerve and reſpect the matter and diſpoſition of the whole body, in which a greater virtue is infuſed, or of the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Then how unlikely is it, and without any ſemblance of truth, that the many almoſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs conjunction of Stars, which occur and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves in the progreſs of a mans life, ſhould match and countervail that one <hi>Horoſcope</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> which is found at his birth? Moreover to find out and know the actions of the free will of a man, of what importance ſhould we hold nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, education, age, the place, his converſation, every one of which after their own manner contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the conſtitution and complexion of the perſon, how great effects muſt all theſe together produce? If that moment of the time of birth be of ſuch moment, whence proceedeth the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of the conſtitutions of Twins, which though together born, have ſtrange, divers and contrary Fortunes in the progreſs of their lives? all that knowledge (if there be any ſuch?) of things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent to which we attain by the aſpects of Stars, is uncertain, frivolous and changable. This the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:175204:228"/>
themſelves confeſſed, when upon conſultations of things to come for the moſt part they gave doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ambiguous anſwers. The Stars are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, miſchievous, ſpiteful, nor by their Aſpects malicious, if they were ſuch, that ſhould be either by election or nature. They are not by Election, for then they ſhould have ſenſes and ſouls, and as Animals be troubled with perturbations, and toſſed like unto us, which followeth election. They are not malicious by nature, ſith God created them, and God is not a Creator of what is evil: nor is the framer of what's not good; the Heavens are all good, and in every degree and figure the Divine bounty ſhineth. Why do not <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> at their pleaſure procreate Kings, for they have no great labour but to chooſe out <hi>opportunam horam,</hi> and ask counſel of the fatal Stars? Had <hi>Giges,</hi> who of a Servant became a King, a kingly Aſpect, or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Tullus</hi> or that <hi>Tartar Tamerlane</hi> Royal Images and Figures? Vain ſhould all Laws be, all ſentences and doom of Judges, vain the Rewards of virtue and good men; vain the puniſhments of vices and evils, if the great beginnings and Originals of them were compelled, driven and forced, and if what is juſt or wrong were not in a man himſelf. The Thief ſhould not be a Thief, the Murtherer a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, wicked and unjuſt they ſhould not be, the one being neceſſitated to ſteal, the other to ſhed blood by the Stars. Truſt in the firſt cauſe God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſcorn vain Predictions. That infinit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eſſence, though the Stars ſhould incline, yea ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate, and be averſe, can countermand and turn them propitious: All things turn unto the beſt unto ſuch as rely on his Eternal goodneſs:</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough it hath been doubted if there be in the ſoul ſuch impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſuper-excellent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as that it can by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and earneſt working of it, deliver knowledge to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without bodily Organs and by the only conceptions and Ideas of it produce real Effects; yet it hath been ever, and of all held as infallible and moſt certain, that it often (either by outward inſpiration, or ſome ſecret motion in it ſelf) is augur of its own misfortunes, and hath ſhadows of approaching dangers preſented unto it before they fall forth. Hence ſo many ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions and ſigns, true viſions, uncouth heavineſs, and cauſeleſs uncomfortable languiſhings, of which to ſeek a reaſon, unleſs from the ſparkling of God in the Soul, or from the Godlike ſparkles of the Soul, were to make unreaſonable by reaſoning of things tranſcending her reach.</p>
            <p>Having often and diverſe times, when I had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven my ſelf to reſt in the quiet ſolitarineſs of the Night, found my imagination troubled with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:175204:229"/>
fear, no, ſorrow or horrour, which interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſleep, did aſtoniſh my ſenſes, and rowſe me all appalled, and tranſported in a ſudden agony and amazedneſs; of ſuch an unaccuſtomed perturbation, not knowing, nor being able to dive into any appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent cauſe, carried away with the ſtream of my then doubting thoughts, I began to aſcribe it to that ſecret fore-knowledge and preſaging power of the prophetick mind, and to interpret ſuch an Agony to be to the Spirit as a faintneſs and univerſal wearineſs uſeth to be to the body, a ſign of following ſickneſs, or as winter Lightnings or Earth-quakes are to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths and great Cities, Harbingers of more wretched events.</p>
            <p>Hereupon not thinking it ſtrange if whatſoever is human ſhould befall me, knowing how providence overcomes grief, and diſcountenances Croſſes; and that as we ſhould not deſpair of evils which may happen us, we ſhould not be too confident, nor lean much to thoſe Goods we enjoy; I began to turn over in my remembrance all that could afflict miſerable Mortality, and to fore-caſt every thing that with a Mask of horror ſhould ſhew it ſelf to human eyes: till in the end, as by unities and points, Mathematicians are brought to great numbers, and huge greatneſs; after many fantaſtical glaunces of the woes of mankind, and thoſe incumbrances which follow upon life, I was brought to think, and with amazement, on the laſt of human terrours, or (as one termed it) the laſt of all dreadful and terrible Evils, Death.</p>
            <p>For to eaſie cenſure it would appear, that the Soul, if it fore-ſee that divorcement which it is to have from the body, ſhould not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be thus over-grieved, and plunged in inconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable and unaccuſtom'd ſorrow: conſidering their
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:175204:229"/>
near union, long familiarity and love, with the great change, pain, uglineſs, which are apprehended to be the inſeparable attendants of Death.</p>
            <p>They had their being together, parts they are of one reaſonable Creature, the harming of the one, is the weakning of the working of the other; what ſweet contentments doth the ſoul enjoy by the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? They are the Gates and Windows of its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Organs of its delight. If it be tedious to an excellent player on the Lute, to abide but a few months the want of one, how much more the being without ſuch noble Tools and Engines be plaintful to the Soul? And if two Pilgrims which have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſome few miles together, have a hearts-grief when they are near to part, what muſt the ſorrow be at the parting of two ſo loving Friends and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-loathing Lovers, as are the Body and Soul?</p>
            <p>Death is the violent eſtranger of acquaintance, the eternal Divorcer of Marriage, the Raviſher of the Children from the Parents, the Stealer of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents from their Children, the interrer of Fame, the ſole cauſe of forgetfulneſs, by which the living talk of thoſe gone away as of ſo many Shadows or age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worn Stories: all ſtrength by it is enfeebled, Beauty turned into deformity and rottenneſs, honour in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Glory into baſeneſs. It is the reaſonleſs breaker off of all Actions, by which we enjoy no more the ſweet pleaſures of Earth, nor gaze upon the ſtately revolutions of the Heavens, Sun perpetually ſetteth, Stars never riſe unto us, It in one moment robbeth us of what with ſo great toil and care in many years we have heaped together: By this are Succeſſions of Linages cut ſhort, Kingdoms left Heirleſs, and greateſt States orphaned: it is not overcome by Pride, ſmothered by Flattery, diverted by time, Wiſdom ſave this, can prevent and help every thing.
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:175204:230"/>
By death we are exiled from this fair City of the World, it is no more a World unto us, nor we no more a People unto it. The ruines of Phanes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, and other magnificent Frames, yield a ſad proſpect to the ſoul, and how ſhould it without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour view the wrack of ſuch a wonderful Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, as is the body?</p>
            <p>That death naturally is terrible and to be abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it can not well and altogether be denied, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a privation of life, and a not-being, and every privation being abhorred of nature, and evil in it ſelf, the fear of it too being ingenerate univerſally in all Creatures; yet I have often thought that even naturally to a mind by only nature reſolved and prepared, it is more terrible in conceit than in verity, and at the firſt Glance, than when well pried into, and that rather by the weakneſs of our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, than by what is in it, and that the marble colours, of Obſequies, Weeping, and funeral pomp (which we our ſelves caſt over) did add much more ghaſtlineſs unto it than otherways it hath. To aver which concluſion, when I had gathered my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, I began thus with my ſelf.</p>
            <p>If on the great Theatre of this Earth amongſt the numberleſs number of men, <hi>To dye</hi> were only proper to thee and thine, then undoubtedly thou hadſt reaſon to repine at ſo ſevere and partial a Law? But ſince it is neceſſity, from the which never an age by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt hath been exempted, and unto which they which be, and ſo many as are to come, are thralled (no conſequent of life being more common and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar) why ſhouldſt thou with unprofitable and nought availing ſtubbornneſs, oppoſe to ſo unevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and neceſſary a Condition? This is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Mortality, our general home, behold what millions have trod it before thee, what multitudes
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:175204:230"/>
ſhall after thee, with them which at that ſame inſtant run. In ſo univerſal a calamity (if death be one) private complaints cannot be heard, with ſo many Royal Palaces, it is no loſs to ſee thy poor Cabin burn. Shall the heavens ſtay their ever-rolling wheels (for what is the motion of them but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſwift and ever whirling wheel, which twineth forth, and again uprolleth our life?) and hold ſtill time, to prolong thy miſerable days, as if the higheſt of their working were to do homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee? Thy death is a piece of the Order of this <hi>All,</hi> a part of the Life of this World, for while the World is the World, ſome Creatures muſt dye, and others take life. Eternal things are raiſed far above this Sphere of a Generation and Corruption, where the firſt Matter, like an ever-flowing and ebbing Sea, with divers Waves, but the ſame Water, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a reſtleſs and never tyring Current; what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in the univerſality of the kind, not in it ſelf doth abide, <hi>Man</hi> a long line of years hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>This Man</hi> every hundred is ſwept away. This Globe environed with air, is the ſole Region of death, the Grave where every thing that taketh life muſt rot, the Stage of Fortune and Change, only glorious in the unconſtancy and varying alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it, which though many, ſeem yet to abide one, and being a certain entire one, are ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. The never agreeing bodies of the Elemental Brethren turn one in another, the Earth changeth her countenance with the ſeaſons, ſometimes looking cold, and naked, other times hot and flowry: Nay, I cannot tell how, but even the loweſt of thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial bodies, that mother of months, and Empreſs of Seas and moiſture, as if ſhe were a Mirrour of of our conſtant mutability appeareth (by her too great nearneſs unto us) to participate of our changes,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:175204:231"/>
never ſeeing us twice with that ſame face, now look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black, then pale and wan, ſometimes again in the perfection and fulneſs of her beauty ſhining over us. Death no leſs than life doth here act a part, the taking away of what is old, being the making a way for what is young. They which forewent us did leave a Room for us, and ſhould we grieve to do the ſame to thoſe which ſhould come after us? Who being ſuffered to ſee the exquiſite rarities of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries Cabinet is grieved that the curtain be drawn, and to give place to new pilgrims? And when the Lord of this Univerſe hath ſhewed us the amazing wonders of his various frame, ſhould we take it to heart, when he thinketh time, to diſlodge? This is his unalterable and unevitable Decree, as we had no part of our will in our entrance into this life, we ſhould not preſume of any in our leaving it, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly learn to will that which he wills, whoſe very will giveth being to all that it wills, and reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Orderer, not repine at the Order and Laws, which all-where and always are ſo perfectly eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that who would eſſay to correct and amend any of them, ſhould either make them worſe, or deſire things beyond the level of poſſibility.</p>
            <p>If thou doeſt complain that there ſhall be a time in the which thou ſhalt not be, why doeſt thou not too grieve that there was a time in the which thou waſt not? And ſo that thou art not as old as that enlifening Planet of time? For not to have been a thouſand years before this moment, is as much to be deplored as not to live a thouſand after it, the effect of them both being one: that will be after us which long, long before we were, was. Our Childrens Children have that ſame reaſon to murmur that they were not young men in our days, which we have to complain that we ſhall not be old in theirs.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:175204:231"/>
The Violets have their time, though they impurple not the winter, and the Roſes keep their ſeaſon though they diſcloſe not their beauty in the Spring.</p>
            <p>Empires, States, Kingdoms, have by the doom of the Supreme Providence, their fatal Periods, great Cities lye ſadly buried in their duſt, Arts and Sciences have not only their Ecclipſes, but their warnings and deaths, the ghaſtly wonders of the world, raiſed by the ambition of ages are overthrown and trampled, ſome Lights above, not idly intitled Stars, are looſed and never more ſeen of us: The excellent Fabrick of this Univerſe it ſelf ſhall one day ſuffer ruin, or a change like a ruin, and poor Earthlings thus to be handled complain.</p>
            <p>But is this Life ſo great a good, that the loſs of it ſhould be ſo dear unto Man? If it be; the meaneſt Creatures of Nature thus be happy, for they live no leſſe than he: If it be ſo great a felicity, how is it eſteemed of Man himſelf at ſo ſmall a rate, that for ſo poor gains, nay, one diſgraceful word, he will not ſtand to loſe it? What excellency is there in it, for the which he ſhould deſire it perpetual, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine to be at reſt, and return to his old Grand-mother Duſt? Of what moment are the labours and actions of it, that the interruption and leaving off of them ſhould be to him diſtaſtful, and with ſuch grudging lamentations received?</p>
            <p>Is not the entering into Life weakneſſe? The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing ſorrow? In the one here is expoſed to all the injuries of the Elements, and like a condemned treſpaſſer (as if it were a fault to come to the light) no ſooner born than mancled and bound; in the other he is reſtleſly like a Ball toſſed in the Tenis-Court of this World, when he is in the brighteſt Meridian of his glory, there miſtereth nothing to deſtroy him, but to let him fall his own height, a
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:175204:232"/>
reflex of the Sun, a blaſt of wind, nay, the glance of an eye, is ſufficient to undo him: How can that be any great matter, which ſo ſmall inſtruments and ſlender actions are Maſters of?</p>
            <p>His body is but a maſs of diſcording humors boiled together by the conſpiring influences of Superior lights, which though agreeing for a trace of time, yet can never be made uniform, and kept in a juſt proportion. To what ſickneſs is it ſubject unto, beyond thoſe of the other creatures; no part of it being which is not particularly infected and afflicted by ſome one, nay, every part with many; ſo that the life of divers of the meaneſt creatures of nature hath with great reaſon, by the moſt wiſe, been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the natural life of man: And we ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonder how ſo fragil a matter ſhould ſo long endure, than how ſo ſoon decay.</p>
            <p>Are the actions of the moſt part of men, much differing from the exerciſe of the Spider; that pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth toyls and is tapiſt, to prey on the ſmaller Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and for the weaving of a ſcornful web eviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>createth it ſelf many daies, which when with much induſtry finiſhed, a tempeſtuous puffe of wind carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away both the work and the worker? Or are they not like the plaies of Children? Or (to hold them at their higheſt rate) as is a May-Game, or what is more earneſt, ſome ſtudy at Cheſſe, every day we riſe and lie down, apparel and diſapparrel our ſelves, weary our bodies and refreſh them, which is a circle of idle Travels, and labours (like <hi>Penelopes</hi> task) unprofitably renewed. Some time we are in a chaſe after a fading Beauty, now we ſeek to enlarge our bounds, increaſe our treaſure, feeding poorly, to purchaſe what we muſt leave to thoſe we never ſaw, or (happily) to a Fool, or a Prodigal heir: raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wind of Ambition, we Court that idle
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:175204:232"/>
name of Honour, not conſidering how they mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aloft in the higheſt aſcendant of Earthly Glory, are but like tortured Ghoſts wandring with golden fetters in gliſtering Priſons having fear and danger their unſeparable executioners, in the midſt of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes rather garded than regarded; they whom opake imaginations and inward melancholy, have made weary of the world, though they have withdrawn themſelves from the courſe of vulgar affairs, by vain contemplations, curious ſearches, are more diſquieted, and live a life worſe than others their wit being too ſharp to give them a taſte of their preſent infelicity, and to increaſe their woes; while they of a more ſhallow and ſimple conceit, have want of knowledge and ignorance of themſelves, far a remedy and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt all the calamities of life.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Camelion,</hi> what <hi>Euripe,</hi> what <hi>Moon,</hi> doth change ſo often as man? he ſeemeth not the ſame perſon, in one and the ſame day, what pleaſeth him in the morning is in the evening unto him diſtaſtful. Young he ſcorns his childiſh conceits, and wading deeper in years (for years are a Sea, into which he wadeth until he drown) he eſteemeth his Youth Unconſtancy, Raſhneſſe, Folly; Old he begins to pitty himſelf, plaining, becauſe he is changed that the world is changed, like thoſe in a Ship, which when they launch from the ſhore, are brought to think the ſhore doth flye from them. When he is freed of evil in his own eſtate, he grudges and vexes himſelf at the happineſs and fortunes of others, he s preſſed with care for what is preſent, with ſorrow for what is paſt, with fear for what is to come, nay, for what will never come, as in the eye one tear for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth out another, ſo makes he one ſorrow follow upon a former, and every day lay up ſtuff of grief for the next.</p>
            <p>The Air, the Sea, the Fire, the Beaſts, be cruel
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:175204:233"/>
executioners of man, yet Beaſts, Fire, Sea and Air, are pittyful to man in compariſon of man, for more men are deſtroyed by men, than by them all. What ſcorns, wrongs, contumelies, impriſonments, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, poyſons, receiveth man of man? What engines and new works of death are found forth by man againſt man? What Laws to thrall his liberty? Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies and ſcarbugs, to inveigle his reaſon? Amongſt the Beaſts is there any that hath ſo ſervile a lot in anothers behalf as Man? Yet neither is content, nor he who reigneth nor he who ſerveth.</p>
            <p>The half of our life is ſpent in Sleep, which hath ſuch a reſemblance to death, and often it ſeparates as it were the Soul from the body, and teacheth it a ſort of being above it, making it ſoar beyond the Sphear of ſenſual delights, and attain Knowledge unto which while the body did awake it could ſcarce aſpire. And who would not, rather than abide chained in his loathſom galey of the world ſleep ever, (that is dye) having all things to one Stay be free from thoſe vexations, miſadventers, contempts, indignities, and many anguiſhes, unto which, this life is invaſſeled and ſubdued? and when looking unto our greateſt contentment and happineſs here, ſeemeth rather to conſiſt in the being releaſed from miſery, than in enjoying of any great good.</p>
            <p>What have the moſt eminent of mortals to glory in? Is it Greatneſs? Who can be great on ſo ſmall a round as is this Earth, and bounded with ſo ſhort a courſe of time? How like is that to Caſtles or imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cities raiſed in the Sky by Chance-meeting Clouds? Or to Gyants modelled (for a ſport) of Snow, which at the hoter looks of the Sun melt away, and ly drowned in their own moiſture? Such an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous viciſſitude towſeth the eſtates of this World.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:175204:233"/>
Is it knowledge? But we have not yet attained to a perfect underſtanding of the ſmalleſt Flower, and why the Graſs ſhould rather be green than red. The Element of Fire is quite put out, the Air is but water rarified, the Earth moveth, and is no more the Center of the Univerſe, is turned into a Magnes; Stars are not fixed, but ſwim in the Ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real ſpaces, Comets are mounted above the Planets, ſome affirm there is another World of Men and Creatures, with Cities and Towers in the Moon, the Sun is loſt, for it is but a cleft in the lower Heavens, through which the light, of the higheſt ſhines. Thus Sciences by the diverſe motions of this Globe of the brain of man are become Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What is all we know, compared with what we know not? We have not yet agreed about the chief good and felicity. It is (perhaps) Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Cunning, how many curioſities be framed by the leaſt Creatures of Nature, unto which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the moſt curious Artizans doth not attain? Is it Riches? What are they but the caſting out of Friends, the Snares of Liberty, Bands to ſuch as have them, poſſeſſing rather, than poſſeſt, metals which nature hath hid (fore-ſeeing the great harm they ſhould occaſion) and the only opinion of man hath brought in eſtimation? Like Thorns which laid on an open hand, may be blown away, and on a cloſing and hard gripping, wound it, Prodigals miſpend them, wretches miskeep them: when we have gathered the greateſt abundance, we our ſelves can enjoy no more thereof, than ſo much as belongs to one man: what great and rich men do by others, the meaner ſort do themſelves. Will ſome talk of our pleaſures? It is not (though in the fables) told out of purpoſe, that pleaſure in haſt being called up to Heaven, did here forget her apparel, which Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:175204:234"/>
thereafter finding (to deceive the World) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired her ſelf with: And if we ſhould ſay the truth of moſt of our Joys, we muſt confeſs they are but diſguiſed ſorrows; the drams of their Honey are ſowred in pounds of Gall, remorſe ever enſueth them, nay in ſome they have no effect at all if ſome weakning grief hath not preceded and forewent them. Will ſome Ladies vaunt of their beauty? That is but skin-deep, of two ſenſes only known, ſhort even of Marble Statues and Pictures, not the ſame to all eyes, dangerous to the Beholder, and hurtful to the Poſſeſſor, an enemy to Chaſtity, a thing made to delight others, more than thoſe which have it, a ſuperficial luſtre hiding bones and the brains, things fearful to be looked upon, growth in years doth blaſt it, or ſickneſs, or ſorrow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting them. Our ſtrength matched with that of the unreaſonable Creatures, is but weakneſs: all we can ſet our eyes on, in theſe intricate mazes of life, is but vain perſpective and deceiving ſhadows, appearing far otherwiſe afar off, than when enjoyed and gazed upon in a near diſtance.</p>
            <p>If death be good, why ſhould it be feared? And if it be the work of nature, how ſhould it not be good? For nature is an Ordinance and Rule, which God hath eſtabliſhed in the creating this Univerſe (as is the Law of a King) which cannot err. Sith in him there is no impotency and weakneſs, by the which he might bring forth what is unperfect, no perverſeneſs of will, of which might proceed any vicious action, no ignorance by the which he might go wrong in working, being moſt powerful, moſt good, moſt wiſe, nay, all-wiſe, all-good, all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; He is the firſt Orderer, and marſhalleth every other Order, the higheſt Eſſence, giving eſſence to all other things, of all cauſes the cauſe, he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:175204:234"/>
powerfully, bounteouſly, wiſely, and maketh (his Artificial Organ) nature do the ſame. How is not death of Nature? Sith what is naturally ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, is ſubject to corruption, and ſuch an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony (which is life) riſing from the mixture of the four Elements, which are the Ingredients of our Body, cannot ever endure; the contrariety of their qualities (as a conſuming Ruſt in the baſer Metals) being an inward cauſe of a neceſſary diſſolution. Again, how is not death good? Sith it is the thaw of all thoſe vanities which the froſt of Life bindeth together. If there be a ſatiety in Life, then muſt there be a ſweetneſs in Death? The Earth were not ample enough to contain her off-ſpring if none died: in two or three Ages (without death) what an unpleaſant and lamentable Spectacle, were the moſt flouriſhing Cities? For what ſhould there be to be ſeen in them, ſave bodies languiſhing and courbing again into the Earth? pale disfigured faces, Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons inſtead of men? And what to be heard, but the exclamations of the young, complaints of the old, with the pittiful cries of ſick and pining Perſons? There is almoſt no infirmity worſe than age.</p>
            <p>If there be any evil in death; it would appear to be that pain and torment, which we apprehend to ariſe from the breaking of thoſe ſtrait bands which keep the Soul and Body together; which, ſith not without great ſtuggling and motion, ſeems to prove it ſelf vehement and moſt extream. The ſenſes are the only cauſe of pain, but before the laſt Trances of Death, they are ſo brought under that they have no (or very little) ſtrength, and their ſtrength leſſening, the ſtrength of pain too muſt be leſſened. How ſhould we doubt, but the weakneſs of ſenſe leſſeneth pain, ſith we know that weakned and maimed parts that receive not nouriſhment, are
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:175204:235"/>
a great deal leſs ſenſible, than the other parts of the body; And ſee that old decrepit perſons leave this World almoſt without pain, as in a ſleep? If bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the moſt ſound and wholſom conſtitution be theſe which moſt vehemently feel pain? It muſt then follow, that they of a diſtemperate and craſie conſtitution, have leaſt feeling of pain, and by this reaſon all weak and ſick bodies ſhould not much feel pain, for if they were not diſtempered and evil complexioned, they would not be ſick. That the Sight, Hearing, Taſte, Smelling leave us without pain, and unawares, we are undoubtedly aſſured, and why ſhould we not think the ſame of the Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? That which is capable of feeling, are the vital Spirits, which in a man in a perfect health are ſpread and extended through the whole body, and hence is it that the whole Body is capable of pain; but in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bodies we ſee that by pauſes and degrees the parts which are furtheſt removed from the heart, become cold, and being deprived of natural heat, all the pain which they feel, is that they do feel no pain. Now, even as before the ſick are aware, the vital ſpirits have withdrawn themſelves from the whole extention of the body, to ſuccour the heart (like diſtreſſed Citizens which finding their walls battered down, fly to the defence of their Cittadel) ſo do they abandon the heart without any ſenſible touch: As the flame, the oyl failing, leaveth the wick, or as light the Air, which it doth inveſt. As to the ſhrinking motions, and convulſions of ſinews and members, which appear to witneſs great pain, let one repreſent to himſelf the ſtrings of an high tuned Lute, which breaking, retire to their natural wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or a piece of Ice that without any outward violence cracketh at a Thaw: No otherwiſe do the finews of the body; finding themſelves ſlack and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:175204:235"/>
unbended from the brain, and their wonted labours and motions ceaſe, ſtruggle, and ſeem to ſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but without either pain or ſenſe. Swooning is a true Pourtrait of Death, or rather it is the ſame, being a ceſſation from all action, and function of ſenſe and life: but in Swooning there is no pain, but a ſilent reſt, and ſo deep and ſound a ſleep, that the natural is nothing in compariſon of it; what great pain then can there be in death, which is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Swooning, and a never again returning to the works and dolorous felicity of life?</p>
            <p>Now although death were an extream pain, ſith it is in an inſtant, what can it be? Why ſhould we fear it? For while we are, it cometh not, and it being come we are no more. Nay, though it were moſt painful, long continuing, and terrible, ugly why ſhould we fear it? Sith fear is a fooliſh paſſion but where it may preſerve; but it cannot preſerve us from Death, yea, rather the fear of it, baniſhing the comforts of preſent contentments, makes death to advance and approach the more near unto us. That is ever terrible which is unknown, ſo do little Children fear to go in the dark, and their fear is increaſed with tales.</p>
            <p>But that perhaps which anguiſheth thee moſt, is to have this glorious pageant of the World, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from thee, in the Spring and moſt delicious ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thy life, for though to dye be uſual, to dye young may appear extraordinary. If the preſent fruition of theſe things be unprofitable and vain, what can a long continuance or them be? Stranger and new Halcyon, why wouldſt thou longer neſtle amidſt theſe unconſtant and ſtormy Waves? Haſt thou not already ſuffered enough of this World, but thou muſt yet endure more?

One year is ſufficient to behold all the magnificence of Nature, nay, even one day and night for more is but the ſame brought again. This Sun, that Moon, theſe Stars, the varying dance of the Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, is that very ſame which the golden age did ſee. They which have the longeſt time lent them to live in, have almoſt no part of it at all, meaſuring it either by the ſpace of time which is paſt, when they were not, or by that which is to come: why ſhouldſt thou then care, whether thy days be many of few, which when prolonged to the uttermoſt, prove, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd with Eternity, as a Tear is to the Ocean? To dye young, is to do that ſoon, and in ſome fewer days, which once thou muſt do; it is the giving over of a Game that after never ſo many hazards, muſt be loſt. When thou haſt lived to that age thou deſireſt, or one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s years, ſo ſoon as the laſt of thy days riſeth above thy Horizon, thou wilt then as now, demand longer reſpit, and expect more to come. It is Hope of long life, that maketh life ſeem ſhort. Who will behold, and with the eye of advice behold the many changes attending on human affairs, with the after-claps of Fortune, ſhall never lament to dye young. Who knows what alterations and ſudden diſaſters, in outward eſtate or inward contentments, in this wilderneſs of the World, might have befallen him who dieth young, if he had lived to be old? Heaven fore-knowing imminent harms, taketh thoſe which it loves to it ſelf before they fall forth. Pure and (if we may ſo ſay) Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Souls, carry their bodies with no ſmall agonies, and delight not to remain long in the dregs of human corruption, ſtill burning with a deſire to turn back

to the place of their reſt, for this World is their Inn, and not their Home. That which may fall forth every hour, cannot fall out of time. Life is a Journey in a duſty way, the furtheſt Reſt is Death, in this ſome go more heavily burdened than others: ſwift and active Pilgrims come to the end of it in the Morning or at Noon, which Tortoiſe-paced Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, clogged with the fragmentary rubbidge of this World, ſcarce with great travel crawl unto at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. Days are not to be eſteemed after the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, but after the goodneſs: more compaſs maketh not a Sphear move compleat, but as round is a little as a large Ring; nor is that Muſitian moſt praiſe-worthy who hath longeſt played, but he in meaſured accents who hath made ſweeteſt melody, to live long hath often been a let to live well. Muſe not how many years thou mighteſt have enjoyed life, but how ſooner thou mighteſt have loſſed it, neither grudge ſo much that it is no better, as comfort thy ſelf that it hath been no worſe: let it ſuffice that thou haſt lived till this day, and (after the courſe of this World) not for nought, thou haſt had ſome ſmiles of fortune, favours of the worthieſt, ſome friends and thou haſt never been disfavoured of the Heaven.</p>
            <p>Though not for life it ſelf, yet that to after-worlds thou mighteſt leave ſome monument that once thou waſt, happily in the clear light of Reaſon, it would appear that life were earneſtly to be deſired: for ſith it is denied us to live ever (ſaid one) let us leave ſome worthy Remembrance of our once here being, and draw out this Span of life to the greateſt length, and ſo far as is poſſible.

Hath not Avarice defaced, what Religion did make glorious? All that the hand of man can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rear, is either overturned by the hand of man, or at length by ſtanding and continuing conſumed, as if there were a ſecret oppoſition in fate, the unevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table decree of the Eternal, to controul our induſtry, and conter-check all our devices and propoſing. Poſſeſſions are not enduring, Children loſe their names, Families glorying (like Marigolds in the Sun) on the higheſt top of Wealth and Honour (no better than they which are not yet born) leaving off to be; So doth Heaven confound what we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by labour and art to diſtinguiſh. That renown by Papers, which is thought to make men immortal, and which neareſt doth approach the life of theſe eternal bodies above, how ſlender it is, the very word of Paper doth import, and what is it when obtained, but a multitude of words, which coming Times may ſcorn. How many millions never hear the names of the moſt famous Writers, and amongſt them to whom they are known, how few turn over their pages, and of ſuch as do, how many ſport at their conceits, taking the verity for a fable, and oft a fable for verity, or (as we do pleaſants) uſe all for recreation? Then the ariſing or more famous, doth darken, and turn ignoble the glory of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, being held as garments worn out of faſhion. Now, when thou haſt attained what praiſe thou couldſt deſire, and thy fame is emblazon'd in many Stories, it is but an Eccho, a meer Sound, a Glow-worm, which ſeen afar, caſteth ſome cold beams, but approached is found nothing, an imaginary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, whoſe good depends on the opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Deſert and Virtue for the moſt part want Monuments and Memory, ſeldom are recorded in the Volumes of admiration, while Statues and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies,

ſith it doth not reach thee, more than darkneſſe doth thoſe far-ſhining Lamps above? Rowſe thy ſelf for ſhame; why ſhouldſt thou fear to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, ſith thy maker and the ſpiritual and ſuper-celeſtial Inhabitants have no bodies? Haſt thou ever ſeen any Priſoner, who when the Jail Gates were broken up, and he enfranchiſed and ſet looſe, would rather plain and ſit ſtill on his Fetters, than ſeek his freedom? Or any Mariner, who in the midſt of Storms arriving near the Shore, would launch fourth again into the Main, rather than ſtrike Sail and joyfully enter the leas of a ſafe Harbour? If thou rightly know thy ſelf, thou haſt but ſmall cauſe of anguiſh; for if there be any reſemblance, of by that which is infinite, in what is finite (which yet by an infinit imperfection is from it diſtant) if thou be not an Image, thou art a ſhadow of that unſearchable Trinity, in thy three eſſential Powers, Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Will, Memory; which though three, are in thee but one, and abiding one, are diſtinctly three: But in nothing more comeſt thou near that Soveraign Good, than by thy perpetuity, which who ſtrive to improve, by that ſame do it prove: Like thoſe that by arguing themſelves to be without reaſon, by the very arguing, ſhew how they have ſome. For, who can what is wholly mortal, more known what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, than the eye can know ſounds, or the ear queſtion about colours; if one had eyes, who would ever deſcant of light or Sorrow? To thee nothing in this viſible World is comparable; thou art ſo woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a beauty and ſo beautiful a wonder, that if but once thou couldſt be gazed upon by bodily eyes, every heart would be inflamed with thy love, and raviſhed from all ſervile baſeneſſe and earthly deſires. Thy being depends not on matter, hence by thine underſtanding, doeſt thou dive into the being of
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:175204:239"/>
every other thing; and therein art ſo pregnant, that nothing by place, ſimilitude, ſubject, time, is ſo conjoined, which thou canſt not ſeperate; as what neither is, nor any ways can exiſt, thou canſt fain, and give an abſtract being unto. Thou ſeemeſt a World in thy ſelf, containing Heaven, Starres, Seas, Earth, Floods, Mountains, Foreſts, and all that liveth: yet reſt thou not ſatiate with what is in thy ſelf, nor with all in the wide Univerſe, until thou raiſe thy ſelf, to the contemplation of that firſt illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intelligence, far above time, and even reaching Eternity it ſelf, into which thou art transformed, for by receiving, thou (beyond all other things) art made that which thou receiveſt. The more thou knoweſt, the more apt thou art to know, not being amated with any object that excelleth in predominance, as ſenſe by objects ſenſible Thy Will is uncompellable, reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, daunting Neceſſity, deſpiſing Danger, triumphing over affliction, unmoved by pitty, and not conſtrained by all the toyls and diſaſters of life. What the Arts-maſter of this Univerſe is in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Univerſe, thou art in the body; and as he is wholly in every part of it, ſo art thou wholly in every part of the body. By thee man is that <hi>Hymen</hi> of eternal and mortal things, that chain together binding unbodied and bodily ſubſtances, without which the goodly Fabrick of this World were unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Thou haſt not thy beginning from the fecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, power, nor action of the elemental qualities, being an immediate maſter piece of that great Maker. Hence haſt thou the forms and figures of all things imprinted in thee from thy firſt Original. Thou onley at once art capable of contraries, of the three parts of time, thou makeſt but one. Thou knoweſt thy ſelf ſo ſeparate, abſolute and diverſe an eſſence from thy body, that thou diſpoſſeſſed of it as it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Thou ſhouldſt be ſo far from repining at this ſeparation, that it ſhould be the chief of thy deſires, ſith it is the paſſage and means to attain thy perfection and happineſs. Thou art here but as an infected and leprous Inn, plunged in a floud of humours, oppreſſed with cares, ſuppreſſed with ignorance, defiled and diſtained with vice, retrograde in the courſe of virtue; ſmall things ſeem here great unto thee, and great things ſmall, folly appeareth wiſedom, and wiſedom folly, Freed of thy fleſhly care, thou ſhalt rightly diſcern the beauty of thy ſelf, and have perfect fruition of that all-ſufficient and all-ſufficing Happineſs, which is GOD himſelf; to whom thou oweſt thy being, to him thou oweſt thy well being, he and happineſs are the ſame. For, if GOD had not happineſs, he were not GOD, becauſe Happineſs is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and greateſt good: If then GOD have happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it cannot be a thing differing from him; for if there were any thing in Him, deffering from him, he ſhould be an eſſence compoſed and not ſimple, more, what is differing in any thing, is either an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or a part of it ſelf: In GOD Happineſs can not be an accident, becauſe he is not ſubject to any accidents, if it were a part of Him (ſince the part is before the whole) we ſhould be forced to grant, that ſome thing was before God. Bedded and bathed in theſe earthly, ordures thou canſt not come near this Soveraign Good, nor have any glimpſe of the afar-off dawning of his unceſſable brightneſs, no, not ſo much as the eyes of the Birds of the Night hath of the Sun. Think then by death, that thy ſhell is broken, and thou then but even hatched, that thou art a Pearl, raiſed from thy Mother to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaced in Gold, and that the death day of thy body, is thy birth day to Eternity.</p>

If the Soul be the Form of the Body, and the form ſeparated from the Matter of it, cannot ever ſo continue, but is inclined and diſpoſed to be reunited thereinto: What can let and hinder this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but that ſome time it be accompliſhed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the expected end, rejoin it ſelf again unto the Body? The Soul ſeparate hath a deſire, becauſe it hath a will, and knows it ſhall by this re-union re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive perfection: too as the matter is diſpoſed, and inclineth to its form when it is without it, ſo would it ſeem that the Form ſhould be towards its matter in the abſence of it. How, is not the Soul the form of the body, ſith by it, it is, and is the beginning and cauſe of all the actions and functions of it: For, though in excellency it paſs every other form, yet doth not that excellency take from it the nature of a form? If the abiding of the Soul from the body be violent, then can it not be everlaſting, but have a regreſs: How is not ſuch an eſtate of being and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not violent to the Soul, if it be natural to it, to be in matter, and (ſeparate) after a ſtrange manner, many of the powers and faculties, of it (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leave it) are not duly exerciſed? This Union ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not above the Horizon of natural Reaſon, far leſs impoſſible to be done by God, and though Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot evidently here demonſtrate, yet hath ſhe a miſty and groping notice. If the body ſhall not

ariſe, how can the onely and Soveraign Good, be perfectly and infinitely good? For, how ſhall he be juſt, nay, have ſo much juſtice as Man, if he ſuffer the evil and vicious, to have a more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and happy life, than the followers of Religion and Virtue; which ordinarily uſeth to fall forth in this life? For, the moſt wicked are Lords and Gods of this Earth, ſleeping in the lee port of honour, as if the ſpacious habitation of the World had been made onely for them; and the virtuous and good, are but forlorn caſt-awaies: floting in the ſurges of diſtreſs, ſeeming here either of the eye of providence not pittied, or not regarded: being ſubject to all diſhonors, wrongs, wracks, in their beſt eſtate, paſſing away their daies (like the <hi>Dazies</hi> in the field) in ſilence and contempt. Sith then he is moſt good, moſt juſt, of neceſſity there muſt be appointed by him another time and place of retribution, in the which there ſhall be a reward for living well, and a puniſhment for doing evil, with a life whereinto both ſhall receive their due, and not onely in their Soules diveſted, for, ſith both the parts or man did act a part in the right or wrong, it carrieth great reaſon with it, that they both be arraigned before that high Juſtice, to receive their own: Man is not a Soul only, but a Soul and body, to which either guerdon or puniſhment is due. This ſeemeth to be the voice of Nature in almoſt all the Religions of the world; this is that general teſtimony, charactered in the minds of the moſt barbarous and ſavage people, all have had ſome roving gueſſes at ages to come, and a dim duskiſh light of another life, all appealing to one general Judgment Throne.

which think that this fair and admirable Frame, ſo variouſly diſpoſed, ſo rightly marſhalled, ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained, enriched with ſo many excellencies, not only for neceſſity, but for ornament and delight, was by that Supream wiſdom brought forth, that all things in a circulary courſe, ſhould be and not be, ariſe and diſſolve, and thus continue: as if they were ſo many Shadows caſt out and cauſed by the encountring of theſe Superior Celeſtial bodies, changing only their faſhion and ſhape, or Fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Imageries, or prints of faces into Chryſtal. No, no, the Eternal Wiſdom hath made man an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creature, though he fain would unmake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and return to nothing: And though he ſeek his felicity among the reaſonleſs Wights, he hath fixed it above. Look how ſome Prince or great King on the Earth, when he hath raiſed any Stately City, the work being atchieved, is wont to ſet his Image in the midſt of it, to be admired and gazed upon: No otherwiſe did the Soveraign of this All, the Fabrick of it perfected, place man (a great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) formed to his own pattern, in the midſt of this ſpacious and admirable City. God containeth all in him as the beginning of all; man containeth all in him as the midſt of all; inferior things be in man more noble than they exiſt; ſuperior things more meanly; Celeſtial things favour him, earthly things are vaſſalled unto him, he is the band of both; neither is it poſſible but that both of them have peace with him, who made the Covenant between them and him. He was made that he might in the Glaſs of the World behold the infinite Goodneſs, Power and glory of his Maker, and beholding know and knowing Love, and loving enjoy, and to hold the Earth of him as of his Lord Parmount; never ceaſing to remember and praiſe Him. It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth

the compaſs of conceit, to think that that wiſdom which made every thing ſo orderly in the parts, ſhould make a confuſion in the whole, and the chief Maſter-piece; how bringing forth ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellencies for man, it ſhould bring forth man for baſeneſs and miſery. And no leſs ſtrange were it, that ſo long life ſhould be given to Trees, Beaſts, and the Birds of the Air, Creatures inferior to Man, which have leſs uſe of it, and which cannot judge of this goodly Fabrick, and that it ſhould not be denied to Man: unleſs there were another manner of living prepared for him, in a place more noble and excellent.</p>
            <p>But alas! (ſaid I) had it not been better that for the good of his native Countrey a ( <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

How long will ye (replyed he) like the Ants, think there are no fairer Palaces, than their Hills; or like to purblind Moles, no greater light, than that little which they ſhun? As if the Maſter of a Camp, knew when to remove a Sentinel, and he who plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Man on the Earth, knew not how long he had need of him? Every one cometh there to act his part of this Tragi-Comedy, called life, which done, the Courtain is drawn, and he removing is ſaid to dye.

Death (ſaid he) nor painful is, nor evil (except in contemplation of the cauſe) being of it ſelf as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different as birth: yet can it not be denied, and amidſt thoſe dreams of earthly pleaſures, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couthneſs of it, with the wrong apprehenſion of

what is unknown in it, are noyſom. But the Soul ſuſtained by its Maker, reſolved, and calmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in it ſelf, doth find that death (ſith it is in a moment of Time) is but a ſhort, nay, ſweet ſigh; and is not worthy the remembrance compared with the ſmalleſt dram of the infinite Felicity of this Place. Here is the Palace Royal of the Almighty King, in which the uncomprehenſible comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly manifeſteth Himſelf; in place higheſt, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not ſubject to any corruption or change, for it is above all motion, and ſolid turneth not; in quantity greateſt, for, if one Star, one Sphere be ſo vaſt, how large, how huge in exceeding demen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, muſt thoſe bounds be, which do them all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? In quality moſt pure and orient, Heaven here is all but a Sun, or the Sun all but a Heaven. If to Earthlings the Foot-ſtool of God, and that Stage which he raiſed for a ſmall courſe of Time, ſeemeth ſo glorious and magnificent; What eſtimation would they make, if they could ſee, of his eternal Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Throne? And if theſe be ſo wonderful, what is the ſight of him, for whom and by whom all was created; of whoſe Glory to behold the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſand part, the moſt pure Intelligences are fully ſatiate, and with wonder and delight reſt amazed, for the beauty of his light, and the light of his beauty are uncomprehenſible? Here doth that earneſt appetite of the underſtanding content it ſelf, not ſeeking to know any more; For it ſeeth before it, in the viſion of the Divine eſſence (a Mirrour in the which not Images or Shadows, but the true and perfect eſſence of every thing created, is more clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

good; which being fully known, cannot (for the infinite motives and cauſes of love which are in him) but be fully and perfectly loved: As he is only the true and eſſential Bounty, ſo is he the only eſſential and true beauty, deſerving alone all Love and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which the Creatures are only in ſo much fair and excellent, as they participate of his Beauty and excelling Excellencies. Here is a bleſſed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, every one joying as much in anothers Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, as in that which is proper, becauſe each ſeeth another equally loved of God; thus their diſtinct joyes are no fewer, than the copartners of the Joy. And as the Aſſembly is in number anſwerable to the large capacity of the place, ſo are the joyes anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the numberleſs number of the Aſſembly. No poor and pittiful mortal, confined on the Globe of Earth, who have never ſeen but ſorrow, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchangeably ſome painted ſuperficial pleaſures, can rightly think on, or be ſufficient to conceive the termleſs delights of this place. So many Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers move not on Birds, ſo many Birds dint not the Air, ſo many leaves tremble not on Trees, ſo many Trees grow not in the ſolitary Foreſts, ſo many waves turn not in the Ocean, and ſo many grains of Sand limit not thoſe Waves: as this triumphant Court hath variety of delights, and Joyes exempted from all compariſon. Happineſs at once here is fully known and fully enjoyed, and as infinite in continuance as extent.

All pleaſure paragon'd with what is here is pain, all Mirth mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all Beauty deformity. Here one daies abiding, is above the continuing in the moſt fortunate eſtate on the Earth many years, and ſufficient to countervail the extreameſt torments of Life. But, although this Bliſs of <hi>Souls</hi> be great, and their joyes many, yet ſhal they admit Addition, and be more full and perfect, at that long wiſhed and general meeting with their bodies</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the wonders of the great Creator, not one appeareth to be more wounderful (replied I) than that our Bodies ſhould ariſe, having ſuffered ſo many changes, and nature denying a return from privation to a Habit.</p>
            <p>Such power (ſaid he) being above all that the Underſtanding of Man can conceive, may well work ſuch wonders; For if Mans Underſtanding could comprehend all the ſecrets and councels of than Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Majeſty, it muſt of neceſſity be equal unto it. The Author of Nature is not thralled to the Laws of Nature, but worketh with them or contrary to them, as it pleaſeth him: What he hath a will to do, he hath a power to perform. To that, power which brought all this <hi>All</hi> from nought, to bring again in one inſtant any ſubſtance which ever was into it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what it was once, ſhould not be thought impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for who can do more can do leſs, and his power is no leſs after that which was by him brought forth is decayed and vaniſhed, than it was before it was produced; being neither reſtrained to certain limits, or inſtruments, or to any determinate and definite manner of working; where the power is without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, the work admitteth no other limits, than the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:175204:244"/>
Workers will. This world is as a Cabinet to God, in which the ſmall things (however to us hid and ſecret) are nothing leſs kept than the great. For, as he was wiſe and powerful to create, ſo doth his knowledge comprehend his own Creation; yea every change and variety in it, of which it is the very Source. Not any Atom of the ſcatter'd Duſt of mankind, though daily flowing under new forms, is to him unknown: and his knowledge doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh and diſcern, what once his power ſhall waken and riſe up. Why may not the Arts-Maſter of the world, like a Molder, what he hath framed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhapes, confound in one maſs, and then ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally faſhion them out of the ſame? Can the Spargirick by his Art reſtore for a ſpace to the dry and withered Roſe, the natural purple and bluſh; and cannot the Almighty raiſe and refine the body of man, after never ſo many alterations on the Earth? Reaſon her ſelf finds it more poſſible for infinit power to caſt out ftom it ſelf a finit world, and reſtore any thing in it; though decaied and diſſolved, to what it was firſt; than for man, a finit piece of reaſonable miſery, to change the form of matter made to his hand; the power of God never brought forth all that it can, for then were it bounded, and no more infinite. That time doth approach (O haſt ye times away) in which the dead ſhall live, and the living be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and of all actions the Guerdon is at hand; then ſhall there be an end without an end, time ſhall finiſh, and place ſhall be altered, motion yielding unto reſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
